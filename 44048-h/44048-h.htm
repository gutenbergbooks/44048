<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The importance of exact chemical analysis in a great
variety of cases which come before the courts is now fully
recognized, and the translation of this excellent little book on
Legal Chemistry, by one of the most distinguished French
Chemists, will be appreciated by a large class of American
readers who are not able to consult the original. While it is
to be regretted that the author has not presented a much more
complete work, there is an advantage in the compact form of
this treatise which compensates, in some degree, for its
brevity.</p>

<p>The translator has greatly increased the value of the book
by a few additions and his copious index, and especially by
the lists of works and memoirs which he has appended; and
while he could have further increased its value by additions
from other authors, we recognize the weight of the considerations
which induced him to present it in the form given to
it by the author. Some chapters will have very little value in
this country at this day, but the translator could not, with
propriety, omit anything contained in the original.</p>

<p class="center middletext">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</p>


<p>The principal change to note in this edition of the
<span class="smcap">Legal Chemistry</span> is the addition of a chapter on Tea
and its Adulteration. The general interest at present
evinced concerning this species of sophistication appeared
to call for a simple and concise method of examination
which would include the requisite tests without entering
upon an exhaustive treatment of the subject. The translator's
practical experience in the testing of tea at the
United States Laboratory of this city has enabled him to
make a few suggestions in this regard which, he trusts,
may be of use to those interested in food-analysis. Numerous
additions have also been made to the bibliographical
appendix.</p>

<p class="largetext center p4"><b>LEGAL CHEMISTRY.</b></p>


<p>The term Legal Chemistry is applied to that branch of the
science which has for its office the solution of problems proposed
in the interest of Justice. These most frequently relate
to cases of poisoning. When the subject of the symptoms or
anatomical lesions produced by the reception of a poison is
under consideration, the services of a medical expert are resorted
to; but when the presence or absence of a poison in
the organs of a body, in the <i>egesta</i> of an invalid or elsewhere
is to be demonstrated, recourse is had to the legal chemist.
Investigations of this character require great practice in manipulation,
and, however well the methods of analysis may be
described in the works on the subject, there would be great
danger of committing errors were the examination executed by
an inexperienced person. The detection of poisons, although
perhaps the most important, is not the only subject that may
come within the province of the legal chemist; indeed, it would
be somewhat difficult to define, <i>a priori</i>, the multitude of questions
that might arise. In addition to cases of supposed poisoning,
the following researches are most often required:</p>

<p>1. The examination of fire-arms.</p>

<p>2. The analysis of ashes, in cases where the destruction of
a human body is suspected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The detection of alteration of writings, and of falsification
of coins and precious alloys.</p>

<p>4. The analysis of alimentary substances.</p>

<p>5. The examination of stains produced by blood and by the
spermatic fluid.</p>

<p>Each of these researches justly demands a more extended
consideration than the limits of this work would permit.
The several subjects will be treated as briefly as possible,
and at the same time, so as to convey an exact idea of the methods
employed, leaving to the expert the selection of the particular
one adapted to the case under investigation. We will first
mention the methods used in the search for toxical substances.
The poisons employed for criminal purposes are sometimes met
with in a free state, either in the stomach or intestines of the
deceased person, or in the bottles discovered in the room of
the criminal or the victim. Under these circumstances, it is
only necessary to establish their identity by means of their
chemical properties, as directed in the general treatises on
chemistry, or by their botanical, or zoological character, in
case a vegetable or animal poison, such as cantharides, has been
administered. Examinations of this class are extremely simple,
the analysis of the substances found, confined to a few characteristic
reactions, being a matter of no great difficulty. We will
not here dwell longer upon this subject, inasmuch as the analytical
methods used are identical with those employed in
more complicated cases, with the sole difference that, instead of
performing minute and laborious operations in order to extract
the poisons from the organs in which they are contained, with
a view of their subsequent identification, we proceed at once
to establish their identity. The directions given in regard to
complicated investigations apply, therefore, equally well to
cases of a more simple nature. The detection of a poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mixed with the organic substances encountered in the stomach,
or absorbed by, and intimately united with the tissues of the
various organs is more difficult. If, however, other information
than chemical can be obtained, indicating the poison
supposed to be present, and the presence or absence of this
one poison is the only thing to be determined, positive methods
exist which admit of a speedy solution of the question.
When, on the other hand, the chemical expert has not the
advantage of extraneous information, but is simply asked,&mdash;whether
the case be one of poisoning?&mdash;nothing being specified
as to the nature of the poison used, the difficulty of his
task is greatly increased. Up to the present time, the works on
Toxicology have, it is true, given excellent special tests for the
detection of particular poisons; but none have contained a
reliable general method, which the chemical expert could use
with the certainty of omitting nothing. Impressed with
this need, we proposed, in 1859, in an inaugural dissertation
then presented to the Faculty of Medicine, a general method,
which, after some slight modifications, is now reproduced. The
special methods which allow of the detection of various individual
poisons will, however, first be indicated. In cases where
the poison is mixed with organic matter, the latter must be
removed as the first step in the investigation, as otherwise the
reactions characteristic of the poison searched for would be
obscured. When the poison itself is an organic substance, this
separation is effected by processes modified according to the
circumstances. If the detection or isolation of a metallic
poison is to be accomplished, the most simple method consists
in the destruction of the organic substances. The various
methods for effecting this decomposition will now be described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="ChI" id="ChI">I.<br/>

METHODS OF DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIC
SUBSTANCES.</a></h2>


<h3>BY MEANS OF NITRIC ACID.</h3>

<p>In order to destroy the organic matters by this process, a
quantity of nitric acid equal to one and a half times the
weight of the substances taken is heated in a porcelain
evaporating dish, the amount of acid being increased to four
or six times that of the organic substances if these comprise
the brains or liver. As soon as the acid becomes warm, the
suspected organs, which have previously been cut into pieces,
are added in successive portions: the organs become rapidly
disintegrated, brownish-red vapors being evolved. When all
is brought into solution, the evaporation is completed and the
carbonaceous residue obtained separated from the dish and
treated either with water, or with water acidulated with nitric
acid, according to the nature of the poison supposed to be
present.</p>

<p>Several objections to this method exist, the most serious of
which is based upon the fact that the carbonaceous residue,
containing, as it may, nitric acid, readily takes fire and may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
therefore be consumed, or projected from the vessel. This
objection is a grave one, and is not always entirely removed
by the continual stirring of the materials. According to <i>M.
Filhol</i>, the addition of 10 to 15 drops of sulphuric acid to the
nitric acid taken obviates the difficulty; not having personally
tested the question we cannot pronounce upon it. If it be
the case, this process is an advantageous one, as it is not
limited in its application, but can be used in the separation of
all mineral poisons.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF SULPHURIC ACID.</h3>

<p>The organic matter to be decomposed is heated with
about one-fifth of its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid,
the complete solution of the materials being thus accomplished.
The excess of acid is next removed by heating until a spongy
carbonaceous mass remains. The further treatment of this
residue depends upon the nature of the poison supposed to
be present. If the sulphate of the suspected poison is a
soluble and stable compound, the residue is directly treated
with water; if, on the contrary, there is reason to think that
the sulphate has suffered decomposition, the mass is taken up
with dilute nitric acid; if, finally, the presence of arsenic is
suspected, the residue is moistened with nitric acid, in order to
convert this body into arsenic acid. The acid is afterwards
removed by evaporation, the well pulverized residue boiled
with distilled water, and the solution then filtered.</p>

<p>This method, when applied in the detection of arsenic, is
objectionable in that the carbonaceous residue, in contact with
sulphuric acid, almost invariably contains sulphurous acid,
detected by means of permanganate of potassa. This acid,
being reduced in the presence of hydrogen, would cause the
formation of insoluble sulphide of arsenic, and in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
prevent the detection of small amounts of arsenic by the use
of Marsh's apparatus. <i>M. Gaultier de Claubry</i>, indeed, states
that he has not been able to detect the presence of sulphurous
acid in the carbonaceous residue; but one affirmative result
would, in this case, outweigh twenty negative experiments. A
further objection to this process consists in the fact that the
materials to be destroyed almost always contain chlorides,
which, in presence of sulphuric acid and an arsenical compound,
might determine the formation of chloride of arsenic,
a volatile body, and therefore one easily lost. This difficulty
is doubtless of a less serious nature than the preceding, as
the operation can be performed in a closed vessel provided
with a receiver which admits of the condensation of the
evolved vapors; but even then the process would be prolonged.
The above method is still again objectionable on account of
its too limited application, it being serviceable almost exclusively
in cases where the poisoning has been caused by arsenic,
for, if applied in other instances, a subsequent treatment
would be necessary in order to redissolve the metal
separated from its decomposed sulphate.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF NITRATE OF POTASSA.</h3>

<p>This method was formerly executed as follows: Nitrate
of potassa was fused in a crucible, and the substances to be
destroyed added in small portions to the fused mass. The
organic matter soon acquired a pure white color; owing, however,
to the imperfect admixture of the organic matter with the
salt used for its decomposition, it was necessary to take a
large excess of the latter.</p>

<p>The following process, suggested by <i>M. Orfila</i>, remedies
this inconvenience: The organs are placed in an evaporating
dish, together with one tenth of their weight of caustic potassa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and a quantity of water varying with the weight of the substances
taken. An amount of nitrate of potassa equal to
twice the weight of the organic matter is next added, and the
mixture evaporated to dryness. The residue is then thrown
by fragments into a Hessian crucible heated to redness, the
portions first taken being allowed to become perfectly white
before more is added.</p>

<p>Whichever process has been employed, the fused mass is
decanted into a porcelain crucible, which has previously been
heated in order to avoid danger of breakage. The portion
remaining in the vessel is taken up by boiling with a small
quantity of distilled water, and the solution so obtained likewise
added to the crucible. The mass is then heated with
sulphuric acid until all nitrous fumes are expelled, as these
could give rise to an explosion, when, in the search for
arsenic, the substance is introduced into Marsh's apparatus.
As soon as the nitric acid is completely expelled, the liquid is
allowed to cool; the greater portion of the sulphate of potassa
formed now separating out in crystals. The fluid is next
filtered and the crystalline salt remaining on the filter,
washed, at first with a little distilled water, then with absolute
alcohol, which is subsequently removed from the filtrate by
boiling. This method is scarcely applicable otherwise than
in the detection of arsenic, as in other instances the presence
of a large amount of sulphate of potassa would be liable to
affect the nicety of the reactions afterwards used. Its application,
even in the search for arsenic, is not to be strongly
recommended; on the contrary, the separation of the potassa
salt by filtration is indispensable, as otherwise a double
salt of zinc and potassium, which might be formed, being
deposited upon the zinc used in Marsh's apparatus, would
prevent the disengagement of hydrogen, and every chemist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is too well aware of the difficulty of thoroughly washing a precipitate,
not to fear the possible loss of arsenic by this
operation.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF POTASSA AND NITRATE OF LIME.</h3>

<p>In this method the organic materials are heated with
water and 10 to 15 per cent. of caustic potassa. As soon
as disintegration is completed, nitrate of lime is added, and
the mixture evaporated to dryness. A glowing coal is then
placed upon the carbonaceous residue obtained: the mass,
undergoing combustion, leaves a perfectly white residue. This
residue dissolves in hydrochloric acid to a clear fluid which
is then examined for poisons.</p>

<p>The above process possesses the undeniable advantage of
completely destroying the organic substances, at the same
time avoiding the introduction of sulphate of potassa, the
presence of which impairs the usefulness of the preceding
method; but it necessitates the presence of numerous foreign
bodies in the substance to be analysed, and this should be
avoided. The <i>absolute purity</i> of reagents is not always to be
attained, and the results of an analysis are the more certain,
in proportion as they are less numerous and more easily
purified.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF POTASSA AND NITRIC ACID.</h3>

<p>It has been proposed, instead of using nitrate of lime, to
dissolve the organic matter in potassa and then saturate the
fluid with nitric acid. This method is evidently more complicated
than the simple treatment with nitrate of potassa, and
possesses, moreover, no advantages over the latter process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF CHLORATE OF POTASSA.</h3>

<p>The organic materials are treated with an equal weight of
pure hydrochloric acid, and water added, so as to form a clear
pulp. This being accomplished, two grammes of chlorate of
potassa are added to the mixture at intervals of about five
minutes. The fluid is next filtered, and the insoluble residue
remaining on the filter washed until the wash-water ceases to
exhibit an acid reaction. The filtrate is then evaporated, an
aqueous solution of sulphurous acid added, until the odor of
this reagent remains distinctly perceptible, and the excess of
the acid removed by boiling the solution for about an hour.
The fluid is now adapted to further examination for arsenic,
or other metallic poisons.</p>

<p>This method is one of the best in use, both chlorate of
potassa and hydrochloric acid being reagents easily procured
in a state of great purity; their use, however, is liable to the
objection that they convert silver and lead into insoluble
chlorides.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF CHLORINE.</h3>

<p><i>M. Jacquelain</i> suggests, in the search for arsenic, the
decomposition of the organic matters by means of a current of
chlorine, and recommends the following process: The organic
substances are bruised in a mortar and then macerated with
water. The fluid so obtained, in which the organic matter is
held suspended, is next placed in a flask into which a current
of chlorine is passed until all the organic matter is deposited
in colorless flakes on the bottom of the vessel. The flask is
then well closed and allowed to stand for 24 hours, when the
odor of the gas should still be perceptible. The fluid is now
filtered, the filtrate concentrated by heating in a vessel which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
permits of the preservation of the volatile chloride of arsenic
possibly present, and then examined for poisons.</p>

<p>This process fails to possess the degree of generality desirable,
and presents the disadvantage of requiring considerable
time for its execution.</p>


<h3>BY MEANS OF AQUA REGIA.</h3>

<p>This method is exceedingly simple: <i>Aqua regia</i> (a mixture
of two parts of hydrochloric and one part of nitric acids) is
placed in a tubular retort provided with a receiver, and the
organic materials, which have previously been cut into small
pieces, added; the reaction commences immediately; if it is not
sufficiently active, it is accelerated by a gentle heat: lively
effervescence now occurs, and the destruction of all non-oleaginous
substances is soon accomplished. The latter substances
alone are not immediately decomposed by <i>aqua regia</i>,
which attacks them only after prolonged action. As soon as
the operation is concluded, the apparatus is removed from
the fire and taken apart. The fluid condensed in the receiver
is added to that remaining in the retort, and the whole
thoroughly cooled in an open dish. The fatty matters now
form a solid crust upon the surface of the fluid, which is removed
and washed with distilled water, and, the washings
being added to the rest of the solution, the latter is directly
examined for metallic poisons. It is recommended by <i>Gaultier
de Claubry</i>, in cases where the detection of arsenic is desired,
to saturate and afterwards boil the suspected fluid with
sulphuric acid, in order to remove the nitric and hydrochloric
acids present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h3>DIALYSIS.</h3>

<p>The application of the dialytic method was first proposed
by <i>Graham</i>. By its use we are enabled to distinguish between
two large classes of bodies, viz., <i>colloids</i> and <i>crystalloids</i>.
Albumen, gelatine, and analogous substances are typical of
colloid bodies; crystalloid substances, on the other hand, are
those that are capable of crystallization, either directly or in
their compounds, or, in case they are fluids, would possess this
property when brought to the solid state. Graham discovered
that when an aqueous solution containing a mixture of colloid
and crystalloid substances is placed in a vessel having for its
bottom a piece of parchment or animal membrane, and this is
immersed in a larger vessel filled with water, all of the
crystalloids contained in the first vessel transverse the porous
membrane and are to be found in the larger vessel, the colloid
bodies being retained above the membrane. The organic
matter to be eliminated in toxicological researches being colloids,
and the poisons usually
employed being crystalloids,
the value of dialysis as a
method of separation is evident.
The process is executed
as follows:</p>

<p>A wooden,&mdash;or better, a
gutta-percha&mdash;cylinder (Fig. 1),
5 cubic centimetres in height
and from 20 to 25 c.&nbsp;c. in
diameter, is employed. A
piece of moistened parchment
is securely attached to one of
the openings of the cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which, upon drying, shrinks and completely closes the aperture.
If its continuity becomes impaired, the pores of the membrane
should be covered with the white of an egg which is
subsequently coagulated by the application of heat. The
organs previously cut into small pieces, or the materials
found in the alimentary canal, etc., after having been allowed
to digest for 24 hours in water at <span class="locked">32°<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></span>&mdash;or, in dilute acids, if
the presence of an alkaloid is suspected,&mdash;are then placed in the
upper vessel, which is termed the dialyser. The whole should
form a layer not over 2 cubic centimetres in height. The
dialyser is next placed in the larger vessel filled with distilled
water. In about 24 hours three-quarters of the crystalloid
substances present will have passed into the lower vessel.
The solution is then evaporated over a
water-bath, and submitted to analysis.
The portion remaining in the dialyser is
decomposed by one of the methods previously
described, in order to effect the
detection of any poisonous substances
possibly present. Instead of the above
apparatus, the one represented in Fig. 2
can be employed. The fluid under examination
is placed in a bell-shaped jar, open
at the top and closed below with a piece
of parchment, which is then suspended
in the centre of a larger vessel containing
water. In other respects the operation
is performed in the same manner
as with the apparatus represented in Fig. 1.</p>

DETECTION OF POISONS, THE PRESENCE OF
WHICH IS SUSPECTED.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></h2>


<h3>DETECTION OF ARSENIC.</h3>

<p>It is frequently required, in chemical jurisprudence, to institute
a search for arsenic in the remains of a deceased person,
whose death is supposed to have been caused by the
reception of a poison. Under these circumstances the poison
is mixed with a mass of substances which would obscure its
characteristic properties, and it becomes necessary, in order to
accomplish its identification, to isolate it, and then, by decisive
reactions, determine its character. Three methods
exist which permit of this result; they are:</p>

<p>1st. The method used prior to Marsh's test.</p>

<p>2nd. Marsh's test.</p>

<p>3rd. A method more recent than Marsh's, proposed by <i>M.
Raspail</i>.</p>


<h4>METHOD USED PRIOR TO MARSH'S TEST.</h4>

<div class="center">
<div class="sevpic">
 <a href="images/fig3.jpg"> <img src="images/fig3t.jpg" alt="Fig. 3." title="Fig. 3." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 3.
 </div>
</div>


<p>The materials supposed to contain arsenic are boiled in
water which has been rendered strongly alkaline by the addition
of pure potassa. The fluid is then filtered, an excess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of hydrochloric acid added, and a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen conducted through it. If arsenic be present in the
suspected fluid, it is soon precipitated as a yellow sulphide.
In dilute solutions the formation of the precipitate fails to
take place immediately, and only a yellow coloration of the
fluid is perceptible; upon slightly boiling the solution, however,
the precipitation of the sulphide is soon induced. The
precipitate is collected on a filter, well washed with boiling
water, and then removed, if present in a quantity sufficient to
admit of this operation. It is next dissolved in <span class="locked">ammonia,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2" href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></span>
and the solution so obtained subsequently evaporated to dryness
on a watch-glass. The residue of sulphide of arsenic
is placed in a tube closed at one end containing nitrate of
potassa in a state of fusion: it is decomposed by this treatment
into a mixture of sulphate and arsenate of potassa, the
reaction being completed in about fifteen minutes. The mixture
is now dissolved in water, and lime water added to the
solution: a precipitate of arsenate of lime is formed, which is
separated from the fluid by filtration, dried, mixed with charcoal,
and introduced into a second tube. A few pieces of charcoal
are then placed in the tube adjoining the mixture and exposed
to a red heat, the part of the tube containing the
arsenical compound being also heated. By this operation
the arsenic acid is reduced to arsenic, which is deposited upon
the cold portion of the tube in the form of a metallic mirror.
This mirror is then identified by subsequent reactions. The
method just described is no longer in use, although the precipitation
of the arsenic by sulphuretted hydrogen is still
often resorted to in its separation from the other metals with
which it may be mixed. The destruction of the organic sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>stances
is, however, accomplished by means of chlorate of
potassa and hydrochloric acid. To insure the complete precipitation
of the arsenic, it is advisable to conduct sulphuretted
hydrogen through the solution, at a temperature of 70°
for twelve hours, and then allow the fluid to remain in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
moderately warm place, until the odor of the gas is no longer
perceptible, the vessel being simply covered with a piece of
paper. The precipitate is next freed from the other metals
possibly present, as directed in the general method of analysis,
collected on a filter, and dissolved in ammonia. The
ammoniacal solution is evaporated on a watch
crystal, as previously described, and the residuary
sulphide reduced to metallic arsenic. This reduction
is effected by a process somewhat different from
the one previously mentioned: the residue is fused, in
a current of carbonic acid gas, with a mixture of carbonate
of soda and cyanide of potassium. The apparatus
employed is represented in Fig. 3: <i>a</i>, is an apparatus
producing a constant supply of carbonic acid.
Upon opening Mohr's clamp, <i>g</i>, the gas passes into
the flask <i>h</i>, which contains sulphuric acid; it is then
conducted, by means of the tube <i>i</i>, into the reduction
tube <i>k</i>, which has an interior diameter of 8 mm.
This tube is represented, in half size, in Fig 4.</p>

<div class="sevpic">
 <a href="images/fig4.jpg"> <img src="images/fig4t.jpg" alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 4.
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reduction is performed as follows: The
sulphide of arsenic is ground in a small mortar, previously
warmed, together with 12 parts of a mixture
consisting of 3 parts of carbonate of soda and 1 part
of cyanide of potassium, both salts being perfectly
dry. The powder thus obtained is placed upon a
piece of paper rolled in the form of a gutter, and introduced
into the reduction tube. The latter is then
turned half round its axis, so as to cause the mixture
to fall in <i>de</i> without soiling the other parts of the
tube. The paper is now withdrawn and the apparatus
mounted. Upon opening the clamp <i>g</i>, and strongly
heating the mixture by either the flame of a gas or an alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
lamp, a mirror-like ring of metallic arsenic is deposited at <i>h</i>,
if this poison be present in the substances under examination.
When the coating is too minute to permit of perfect identification,
it should be driven by heat to a thinner part of the
tube; in this way it is rendered easily visible, being condensed
upon a smaller space.</p>

<p>The above process possesses the advantage of not allowing
arsenic to be confounded with any other body; it also permits
of a quantitative estimation of the poison present. For
this purpose, it is only necessary to previously weigh the watch-crystal,
upon which the ammoniacal solution of sulphide of
arsenic was evaporated, and to determine its increased weight
after the evaporation; the difference of the two weighings
multiplied by 0.8049, gives the corresponding weight of
arsenious acid, and by 0.6098, the weight of the corresponding
amount of metallic arsenic.</p>


<h4>MARSH'S TEST.</h4>

<p>Marsh's test is based upon the reduction of arsenious and
arsenic acids by nascent hydrogen, and the subsequent transformation
of these bodies into water and arsenetted hydrogen,
a compound from which the arsenic can be readily isolated.
When pure hydrogen is generated in a flask having two openings,
one of which is provided with a perforated cork through
which a safety-tube passes, the other with a tube bent at a
right angle and drawn out to a small point at the free extremity,
the evolved gas, if ignited, burns with a pale non-luminous
flame. The air should be completely expelled from the apparatus
before igniting the gas. Upon bringing a cold porcelain
saucer in contact with the point of the flame, only water is
formed. If, however, a small quantity of a solution containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
arsenious or arsenic acids is introduced into the apparatus
by means of the safety-tube, arsenetted hydrogen is produced.
This gas burns with a bright flame, yielding fumes of arsenious
acid. In case a large amount of the poison is present, it
can be recognized by the appearance of the flame, and by inclining
a glass tube towards it upon which a portion of the
arsenious acid becomes deposited. These indications are,
however, not distinguishable in presence of only a small amount
of arsenic, and the following distinctive properties of the gas
should be verified:</p>

<p>1st. At an elevated temperature it is decomposed into its
two constituent elements.</p>

<div class="sevpic">
 <a href="images/fig5.jpg"> <img src="images/fig5t.jpg" alt="Fig. 5." title="Fig. 5." /></a>
 <div class="caption">

</div>

 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 6.
 </div>
</div>

<p>2nd. The combustibility of the constituents differs: the
arsenic being less combustible than the hydrogen, begins to
burn only after the complete consumption of the latter body has
taken place. For this reason the flame (Fig. 5) is composed
of a dark portion <i>O</i> and a luminous
portion <i>I</i>, which surrounds
the first. The maximum
temperature exists in <i>O</i> at the
point of union of the two parts
of the flame. Owing to an insufficient
supply of oxygen, the
complete combustion of the arsenic in this part of the
flame is impossible, and if it be intersected by the cold surface
<i>A B</i>, that body is deposited as a brown spot, possessing
a metallic lustre. The metallic deposit originates, therefore,
from the decomposition of the arsenetted hydrogen by heat
and from its incomplete combustion. If the spot is not
large, it fails to exhibit a metallic lustre; an experienced
chemist, however, will be able to identify it by the aid of proper
tests. Spots are sometimes obtained when the substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
under examination does not contain the least trace of arsenic.
These may be caused by antimony or by a portion of the
zinc salt in the generating flask being carried over by the
gaseous current. This difficulty is remedied by giving the apparatus
the form represented in Fig. 6. <i>A</i> is the flask in
which the gas is generated. The delivery-tube <i>I</i> connects with
a second tube <i>H</i>, filled with asbestus or cotton; this is united
by means of a cork with a third tube <i>C</i>, made of Bohemian
glass. The latter tube is quite long, and terminates in a jet
at its free end, enclosed in <span class="locked">tin-foil;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3" href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></span> it passes through the
sheet-iron furnace <i>R</i>, supported upon <i>G</i>. The screen <i>D</i> protects
the portion <i>D E</i> of the tube <i>C</i> from the heat. The gas
disengaged is ignited at <i>E</i> and the porcelain dish <i>P</i> is held by
the hand in contact with the flame. The apparatus being
mounted, zinc, water and some sulphuric acid are placed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
generating <span class="locked">flask,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4" href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></span> and the solution containing arsenious acid
added: the evolution of gas commences immediately. The
tube <i>H</i> serves to retain any liquids that may be held suspended.
The gas then passes through the part <i>C D</i> of the tube <i>C</i>,
which is heated by placing a few live coals upon the furnace <i>R</i>.
The greater portion of the arsenetted hydrogen is decomposed
here, and is deposited on the cold part of the tube, in a mirror-like
ring. The small quantity of gas that escapes decomposition,
if ignited at <i>E</i>, produces a metallic spot on the
dish <i>P</i>. In order to determine that the spots are due to the
presence of arsenic, and not produced by antimony, the following
tests should be applied:</p>


<p>1. The color of the spots is distinctive: arsenical spots are
brown and exhibit a metallic lustre, whereas those originating
from antimony possess a black color, especially near their
border. This difference is, however, not perceptible when
the deposits have a large surface.</p>

<p>2. If the mirror be arsenical, it is readily volatilized from
one part of the tube to another, when the latter is heated,
and a current of hydrogen, or carbonic acid gas made to
pass through it. Spots that are due to the presence of antimony
are much less volatile.</p>

<p>3. If the tube is held in an inclined position so that a current
of air traverses it, and the part containing the arsenical
mirror heated, the arsenic oxidizes and arsenious acid is
sublimed and deposited higher up in the tube in the form
of a ring, which exhibits octahedral crystals when examined
with a magnifying glass. This ring should be further tested
as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> If it is dissolved in a drop of hydrochloric acid and a so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>lution
of sulphuretted hydrogen added, a yellow precipitate of
sulphide of arsenic is formed. This compound is soluble in
ammonia and in alkaline sulphides, but insoluble in hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> If the ring is dissolved in pure water and an ammoniacal
solution of sulphate of copper added, a beautiful
green precipitate ("<i>Scheele's green</i>"), consisting of arsenite of
copper, is produced.</p>

<p>4. When produced by arsenic the spots are soluble in
nitric acid, and upon evaporating the solution so obtained to
dryness, a residue of arsenic acid, which is easily soluble in
water, remains. If an ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver
is added to the aqueous solution of the residue, a brick-red
precipitate is produced. Spots consisting of antimony give,
when treated with nitric acid, a residue of an intermediate
oxide, insoluble in water.</p>

<p>5. Upon treating the spots with a drop of solution of
sulphide of ammonium, the sulphide of the metal present is
formed: if sulphide of arsenic is produced its properties, as enumerated
above, can be recognized. It may be added that the
sulphide of antimony formed is soluble in hydrochloric acid,
and possesses an orange red color, whereas sulphide of arsenic
is yellow.</p>

<p>6. When spots originating from arsenic are treated with
a solution of hypochlorite of soda (prepared by passing chlorine
into solution of carbonate of soda), they are immediately
dissolved; if, on the other hand, they are produced by antimony,
they remain unaltered by this treatment.</p>

<p>Such are the properties exhibited by soluble compounds of
arsenic when treated by Marsh's process; the following precautions
are, however, necessary when this test is made use of
in medico-legal examinations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>1. If small white gritty particles, resembling arsenious
acid, are discovered in the stomach or intestines, they are
directly introduced into Marsh's apparatus. When this is not
the case, the destruction of the organic matter is indispensable
even though, instead of the organs themselves, the contents
of the alimentary canal are taken. In the latter instance,
the solids are separated from the fluids present by filtration,
the solution evaporated to dryness and the residue united
with the solid portion; the organic matter is then destroyed by
one of the methods previously described. In the special case
of arsenic, the separation of the poison from the accompanying
organic materials can be accomplished by a process not yet
mentioned which may prove to be of service. The suspected
substances are distilled with common salt and concentrated
sulphuric acid. By this operation the arsenic is converted
into a volatile chloride which distils over. The poison is
isolated by treating this compound with water, by which it is
decomposed into hydrochloric and arsenious acids. We
must give preference, however, to the method by means of
chlorate of potassa and hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>2. The solution having been obtained in a condition suitable
for examination, the air is completely expelled from the apparatus
by allowing the gas to evolve for some time, and the
suspected fluid then introduced into the generating flask. Danger
of explosion would be incurred were the gas ignited
when mixed with <span class="locked">air.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5" href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<p>3. It is indispensable, in applying this test, to have a
second apparatus in which only the reagents necessary to
generate hydrogen are placed: in this way, if no spots are
now produced by the use of the second apparatus, it is
certain that those obtained when the first apparatus is employed
do not originate from impurities present in the reagents
used.</p>

<p>It has come under the author's observation, however, that a
sheet of zinc sometimes contains arsenic in one part and not in
another; in fact, the shavings of this metal, as purchased for
laboratory use, are often taken from lots previously collected,
and may therefore have been prepared from several different
sheets. If this be the case, it is supposable that the zinc
used in the second apparatus may be free from arsenic,
whereas the metal with which the suspected solution is
brought in contact may contain this poison; serious danger
would then exist of finding indications of the presence of arsenic
in materials that did not originally contain a trace of the
metal. In order to obviate this important objection, which
might possibly place a human life in jeopardy, we propose
the following modifications: Pure mercury is distilled and its
absolute purity established. As the metal is a fluid and is therefore
homogeneous, it is evident if one portion be found
pure, the entire mass is so. Sodium is then fused under oil
of naphtha, in order to cause the complete admixture of its
particles, and the purity of the fused metal in regard to
arsenic tested. An amalgam is next prepared by uniting
the mercury and sodium. This is eminently adapted to toxicological
investigations: in order to generate a supply of
very pure hydrogen, it is only necessary to place the amalgam
in water kept slightly acid by the addition of a few drops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of sulphuric acid, by means of which the disengagement of
gas is rendered more <span class="locked">energetic.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6" href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></span></p>


<p>It should be borne in mind that the solution introduced into
Marsh's apparatus must not contain organic substances, and
that, in case their destruction has been accomplished by means
of nitric acid all traces of this compound are to be removed.
The sulphuric acid used should also be completely freed from
nitrous vapors. According to <i>M. Blondeau</i>, nascent hydrogen
in the presence of nitrous compounds converts the acids
of arsenic not into arsenetted hydrogen (As H<sup>3</sup>), but into
the <i>solid</i> arsenide of hydrogen (As<sup>4</sup> H<sup>2</sup>). This latter compound,
upon which pure nascent hydrogen has no effect, is
transformed into gaseous arsenetted hydrogen by the simultaneous
action of nascent hydrogen and organic substances.
These facts are of the greatest importance, for they might possibly
cause a loss of arsenic when it is present, as well as determine
its discovery when it is absent.</p>

<p>The first case is supposable: should traces of nitric acid
remain in the solution, the arsenic would be transformed into
solid arsenide of hydrogen and its detection rendered impossible.
The second case may also occur: if the zinc placed in
the apparatus contains arsenic, and the sulphuric acid used contains
nitrous compounds, the evolved gas will fail to exhibit
any evidence of the presence of arsenic, owing to the formation
of the solid arsenide of hydrogen. Upon adding the suspected
solution, which, perchance, may still contain organic
substances, this arsenide is converted into arsenetted hydrogen,
and the presence of arsenic will be detected, although the solution
under examination was originally free from this metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h4>RASPAIL'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>M. Raspail suggests the following method for detecting
arsenic: The surface of a brass plate is rasped by filing. In
this condition the plate may be regarded as an innumerable
quantity of voltaic elements, formed by the juxtaposition of
the molecules of zinc and copper. The suspected materials
are boiled with caustic potassa, the solution filtered, a drop of
the filtrate placed upon the brass plate, and a drop of chlorine
water added. If the plate is then allowed to stand for a
moment and the substance under examination contains arsenic,
a mirror-like spot is soon deposited upon its surface. In
order to avoid confounding this deposit with those produced
by other metals, the substitution of granulated brass for the
plate is in some cases advisable. The granulated metal is
dipped successively in the suspected solution and in chlorine
water. The granules retain a small quantity of the solutions
and, owing to the action of the chlorine water, become covered
with metallic spots, if arsenic be present. They are then
dried, placed in a tube closed at one end, and exposed to the
heat of an alcohol lamp. In case the spots are arsenical,
the metal volatilizes and condenses in a ring upon the cold
part of the tube, which is submitted to the tests previously
described.</p>

<p>This method can hardly be of great service, inasmuch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it extracts the poison from but a very small portion of the solution
containing it: we have not, however, personally tested
its <span class="locked">merits.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7" href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></span></p>



<h3>DETECTION OF ANTIMONY.</h3>

<p>Strictly speaking the salts of antimony are more therapeutic
than poisonous in their action. In fact they usually
act as emetics and, under certain circumstances, may be taken
in large doses without incurring serious results. There are
instances, however, in which their action is truly toxical, and
it becomes necessary to effect their detection in the organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of a body. It should be remarked that these salts, if absorbed,
remain by a kind of predilection in the liver and spleen. A
special examination of these organs should therefore be instituted,
particularly if the fluids of the alimentary canal are not
at hand, which is frequently the case when some time has
elapsed before the investigation is undertaken.</p>

<p>The remarks made in the preceding article concerning the
distinctive properties of arsenic and antimony need not be
repeated here. The search for antimony is likewise executed
by aid of Marsh's apparatus. We will confine ourselves to a
description of a modification to this apparatus proposed by
<i>MM. Flandin</i> and <i>Danger</i>, and employed in the separation of
antimony and arsenic, when a mixture of these metals is under
examination. Another process, by means of which we arrive
at the same result with greater certainty and by the use of a
less expensive apparatus, will then be mentioned. We will,
however, first indicate the preferable method of destruction
of the organic substances.</p>

<p>Were the decomposition performed by means of sulphuric
acid, sulphate of antimony, a slightly soluble salt and one
not well adapted to the subsequent treatment with nascent
hydrogen, would be formed. In order to obtain the metal in a
soluble state, the formation of a double tartrate of antimony
and soda is desirable. This may be accomplished in the
following manner:</p>

<p>1. A cold mixture of nitrate of soda, sulphuric acid, and the
suspected materials is prepared in the proportion of 25 grammes
of the nitrate to 39 grammes of the acid, and 100 grammes
of the substance under examination. This mixture is heated
and evaporated to dryness, and the decomposition of the organic
matter completed in the usual manner. The carbonaceous
residue obtained is pulverized, and then boiled with a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of tartaric acid. By this treatment the antimonate of soda
present is converted into a double tartrate of antimony and
soda, which is easily soluble in water. The solution is filtered
and then introduced into Marsh's apparatus.</p>

<p>2. Another method consists in heating the substances
under examination with one half of their weight of hydrochloric
acid for six hours on a sand-bath, avoiding boiling. The
temperature is then increased until the liquid is in a state of
ebullition, and 15 to 20 grammes of chlorate of potassa, for every
100 grammes of the suspected matter taken, added in successive
portions, so that a quarter of an hour is required for the operation.
The liquid is next filtered, and the resinous matter
remaining on the filter well washed with distilled water; the
washings being added to the principal solution. A strip of
polished tin is then immersed in the liquid: in presence of a
large amount of antimony the tin becomes covered with a
black incrustation: if but a minute quantity of the metal is
contained, only a few blackish spots are perceptible. After
the tin has remained immersed for 24 hours, it is withdrawn
and placed in a flask together with an amount of hydrochloric
acid sufficient for its solution in the cold. If, after several
hours, blackish particles are still observed floating in the
liquid, they can be dissolved in a few drops of <i>aqua regia</i>.
The solution may then be directly introduced into Marsh's
apparatus.</p>


<h4>APPARATUS PROPOSED BY FLANDIN AND DANGER.</h4>

 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 7.
 </div>
</div>

<p>This apparatus consists of a wide necked jar <i>A</i> (Fig. 7) for
the generation of the gas, the mouth of which is closed with
a cork having two openings. The safety tube <i>S</i>, which is
funnel-shaped at its upper extremity and has its lower end
drawn out to a point, passes through one of these apertures;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the other opening contains the small delivery tube <i>B</i>, open at
both ends, and terminating in a point at its upper extremity:
it is also provided with lateral openings, in order to prevent
the solution being carried up to the flame. The second part
of the apparatus is the condenser <i>C</i>, 0.03 metre in diameter,
and 0.25 metre in length. This terminates at its lower extremity
with a cone, and connects at the side with the tube <i>T</i>,
slanting slightly downwards. In the interior of the condenser,
the cooler <i>E</i> is contained, the lower end of which is nearly in
contact with the sides of the opening <i>O</i>. The combustion tube
<i>D</i>, 0.01 metre in diameter, is connected by means of a cork
with the tube <i>T</i>; it is bent at right angles, and encloses the
tube <i>B</i>, in such a manner as to allow the evolved gas to burn
in its interior. The dish <i>F</i> is placed beneath the opening <i>O</i>.
If the gas which burns in the combustion tube contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
arsenetted hydrogen, water and arsenious acid are produced.
A portion of this acid is retained in the tube <i>D</i>, the remainder
is carried over, with the aqueous vapor, into <i>C</i>, where it condenses,
and finally falls into the dish <i>F</i>. Both portions are subsequently
examined by means of reactions necessary to establish
the presence of the acid. If the ignited gas contains antimonetted
hydrogen, water and an intermediate oxide of antimony
are formed. The latter compound is entirely retained in the
tube <i>D</i> separated from the greater part of the arsenious acid,
if this body be present, and can be brought into solution by
means of a mixture of hydrochloric and tartaric acids. A fluid
is then obtained which can be introduced into Marsh's apparatus,
or otherwise examined for antimony.</p>


<h4>NAQUET'S APPARATUS.</h4>

<div class="sevpic">
 <a href="images/fig8.jpg"> <img src="images/fig8t.jpg" alt="Fig. 8." title="Fig. 8." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 8.
 </div>
</div>

<p>Although the separation of arsenic from antimony is the
chief object in making use of the apparatus proposed by
Flandin and Danger, it is evident that this result is not fully
accomplished, since a small portion of arsenious acid remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in the tube <i>D</i> (Fig. 7), together with the intermediate oxide of
antimony. The following method secures the complete separation
of these metals: An amalgam of sodium and mercury is
introduced into the flask <i>A</i>, (Fig. 8), which is provided with
two openings. The tube <i>B</i>, terminating in a funnel at its upper
extremity, passes through one of these orifices. The other
aperture contains a cork enclosing the small tube <i>C</i>, which is
bent at a right angle and communicates, by means of a cork,
with the larger tube <i>D</i> filled with cotton or asbestus. A set
of Liebig's bulbs, <i>E</i>, containing a solution of nitrate of silver,
is attached to the other extremity of this tube. The apparatus
being mounted, the solution under examination is slightly
acidulated and introduced by means of the tube <i>B</i> into the
flask <i>A</i>: the disengagement of gas begins immediately. If
arsenic and antimony are contained in the solution, arsenetted
hydrogen and antimonetted hydrogen are evolved. Both
gases are decomposed in passing through the solution of nitrate
of silver contained in the Liebig bulbs: the arsenetted hydrogen
causes a precipitation of metallic silver, all the arsenic remaining
in solution as arsenious acid; the antimonetted
hydrogen is decomposed into insoluble antimonate of silver.
After the operation has continued for several hours, the apparatus
is taken apart, the nitrate of silver solution thrown on a
filter, and the precipitate thoroughly washed. An excess of
hydrochloric acid is then added to the filtrate, and the precipitate
formed separated from the solution by filtration, and
well washed. The wash-water is added to the solution, and
the whole then examined for arsenic by means of Marsh's
test.</p>

<p>The precipitate formed in the nitrate of silver solution,
which contains antimonate of silver, is well dried, mixed with
a mixture of carbonate and nitrate of soda, and calcined in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
porcelain crucible for about three-quarters of an hour. The
crucible is then removed from the fire, and the cooled mass
treated with hydrochloric acid until a drop of the filtered
fluid ceases to give a residue when evaporated upon a watch-glass
to dryness. A current of sulphurous acid is now conducted
through the filtered solution until the odor of this gas
remains persistent. The excess of acid is then removed by
boiling, and the solution placed in Marsh's apparatus and
tested for antimony.</p>


<h3><a name="DETECTION_OF_MERCURY" id="DETECTION_OF_MERCURY"></a>DETECTION OF MERCURY.</h3>

<p>If a mercurial salt exists in a considerable quantity in the
substances extracted from the alimentary canal, or ejected
either by stools or vomiting, it can be isolated by treating
these materials with water, filtering the liquid, and evaporating
the filtrate to dryness. The residual mass is taken up with
alcohol, and the solution again filtered and evaporated.
Upon dissolving the residue obtained by this operation in
ether and filtering and evaporating the solution, a residue is
obtained which when dissolved in water forms a fluid wherein
the presence of mercury can be detected by means of the
ordinary tests.</p>

<p>When, however, only a minute quantity of mercury is
present, and this has been absorbed, its detection is more
difficult. It will be necessary under these circumstances to
make use of either Smithson's pile or Flandin and Danger's
apparatus.</p>


<h4>SMITHSON'S PILE.</h4>

<p>Smithson's pile consists of a small plate of copper around
which a piece of thin gold foil is wrapped. This is immersed
in the solution to be tested for mercury, which has previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been slightly acidulated: if mercury be present, the plate
acquires a white color which disappears upon exposure to the
flame of a spirit-lamp. A similar reaction occurs in presence
of tin, as this metal would likewise be deposited upon the
plate, and, upon heating, would penetrate the metal and restore
to it its natural color. The danger of mistake arising
from this fact is obviated by introducing the copper plate into
a tube closed at one end and bent at a right angle. The
open extremity of the tube is drawn out to a fine point and
immersed in water contained in a second tube also closed at
one end. Upon heating the plate in the flame of an alcohol
lamp, the white color disappears if produced by mercury, and
at the same time this metal condenses in the narrow extremity
of the tube. The metallic globules formed can be recognized
either by the naked eye or with the aid of a lens, or by rubbing
them with a piece of gold foil when the latter will acquire
a white coating.</p>

<p>When Smithson's pile is employed, the organic substances
are most advantageously decomposed by means of chlorine.
It is advisable to operate with as small a quantity of fluid as
possible, for, owing to the volatility of bichloride of mercury,
a portion of this salt may be lost by the evaporation of
aqueous, alcoholic, and even etherial solutions, and the detection
of minute quantities rendered impossible.</p>


<h4>APPARATUS PROPOSED BY FLANDIN AND DANGER.</h4>

<div class="sevpic">
 <a href="images/fig9.jpg"> <img src="images/fig9t.jpg" alt="Fig. 9." title="Fig. 9." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 9.
 </div>
</div>

<p>This apparatus consists of a stand <i>S</i>, (Fig. 9) supporting a
balloon <i>A</i>, which serves as the reservoir of the suspected solution,
and a funnel <i>B</i>, into which the neck of the balloon is
dipped. The funnel <i>B</i> is bent at a right angle and is drawn out
at its lower end under which the dish <i>C</i> is placed for the
reception of the escaping fluids. A fine wire of pure gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
forming the negative electrode of a Bunsen's battery, passes
through the lower extremity of the
funnel. The end of this wire nearly
comes in contact with a second wire, inserted
in the upper part of the funnel,
and connected with the positive pole of
the battery. If the balloon filled with
the solution is inverted and immersed
in the funnel <i>B</i>, its neck will be submerged
at first; soon, however, it becomes
uncovered, owing to the depression
of the level of the fluid caused by the
escape of the latter through the tapering
extremity of the funnel: a bubble of air
then passes in the balloon and expels a
drop of the solution. This process
is repeated at short intervals, causing a continuous flow
of the fluid, the rapidity of which is easily regulated by
elevating or lowering the balloon, thus raising or depressing
the level of the liquid. The apparatus having been mounted
in this manner and the battery set in action, the disengagement
of gas commences. Should mercury be contained in the
solution under examination, this metal will be deposited upon
the negative wire. When the operation is completed this
wire is detached from the apparatus, washed with ether, and
dried. It is then introduced into a small tube provided with
a bulb, and the mercury volatilized by means of the blow pipe
flame: the metal condenses in the bulb of the tube in
globules which are readily recognized. They can also be dissolved
in nitric acid, and the presence of a mercurial salt in
the solution confirmed by further tests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The solution to be examined in the preceding apparatus,
is prepared as follows:</p>

<p>The suspected organic matter is treated with cold sulphuric
acid of 66° <i>B.</i> until liquefied, and hypochlorite of lime, and distilled
water then added: if necessary, the evolution of chlorine
can be accelerated by a further addition of sulphuric acid.
As soon as the liquid becomes clear, it is filtered, concentrated
and examined as described above. The solution contains
the mercury in the state of bichloride, a salt soluble in
water and well adapted to the above test.</p>

<p>The substitution of a large balloon, having a capacity of
about 2 litres, in place of the small vessel of Flandin and
Danger's apparatus, is to be recommended as doing away with
the necessity of evaporation; an operation which invariably
causes a loss of substance. The apparatus, modified in this
manner, is the most delicate in use for the detection of
mercury.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF PHOSPHORUS.</h3>


<h4>ORFILA'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>The solid substances found in the alimentary canal are
mechanically separated from the fluids present by means of a
linen cloth. They are then examined by aid of a magnifying
glass, and any fragments of phosphorus found separated
and preserved under water. If none are discovered, the
presence of phosphorescent vapors may possibly be detected
by examining the materials in the dark. In any case, a portion
of the suspected materials should be treated with nitrate
of silver: in presence of phosphorus the materials acquire,
first, a reddish-brown, then, a black color. The remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
portion is spread upon a shovel and heated: a white flame,
burning at various points of the mass, and originating from
the combustion of phosphorus, is observed, if this body be
contained in the substances under examination. This method
is evidently far from perfect.</p>


<h4>MITSCHERLICH'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>Mistcherlich's method is based upon the luminosity of the
vapors of phosphorus. The suspected materials are moistened
with dilute sulphuric acid, and heated, in a flask communicating
with a glass worm which passes through a glass cooler into a
receiver. If the apparatus is placed in the dark, and the
materials contain phosphorus, luminous vapors will be observed
in the flask and receiver. When the quantity of the poison
present is considerable, the phosphorous acid formed can be
collected and its properties tested.</p>


<h4>DUSART'S METHOD, AS MODIFIED BY BLONDLOT.</h4>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Dusart's process takes advantage of the facility with which
hydrogen combines with phosphorus. The substances under
examination are placed between two asbestus stoppers in a
tube, one end of which tapers to a point, and a current of
pure hydrogen conducted over them. In presence of phosphorus
the evolved gas will burn with a green flame, and, upon
bringing this in contact with a porcelain plate, red spots will
be deposited upon the latter. <i>Blondlot</i> prefers to introduce
the suspected materials into the flask in which the hydrogen
is generated. He employs the apparatus represented in Fig.
10: <i>a</i> is a flask for evolving hydrogen; <i>b</i> is a U tube, filled
with fragments of pumice stone which are saturated with a
concentrated solution of potassa; <i>c</i> is a Mohr clamp; <i>d</i> a
screw-clamp; <i>e</i> a platinum jet. This jet is necessary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
order to avoid a yellow coloration of the flame by the soda
contained in the glass. Pure hydrogen is at first evolved, in
order to ascertain that the flame is colorless and red spots
are not produced when it is intersected by a cold plate. The
purity of the reagents used having thus been confirmed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
clamp <i>d</i> is closed until the acid is forced back into <i>f</i>; and the
materials to be examined are then added to the fluid. Upon
opening the clamp the liquid passes from <i>f</i> into <i>a</i>, and the
evolution of gas recommences. The gas is then ignited: the
flame possesses the characteristic properties mentioned above,
if the suspected substances contain phosphorus.</p>


<h4>METHOD PROPOSED BY FRESENIUS AND NEUBAUER.</h4>

<p>According to this method, the materials are brought into a
flask provided with a doubly-perforated stopper, and water,
acidulated with sulphuric acid, added. The flask is then
heated over a water-bath, and a current of carbonic acid
conducted through the mixture for at least two hours. The
gas, on leaving the flask, passes into a solution of nitrate of
silver. Should no precipitate form in this solution, the absence
of free phosphorus is established, for, were this body present,
a portion would be volatilized, and a black precipitate, consisting
of phosphide of silver, together with phosphoric acid,
produced. The formation of a black precipitate is, however,
not necessarily a proof of the presence of phosphorus. In
order to conclusively determine the character of the precipitate,
it is collected on a filter and examined by the method of
Dusart and Blondlot.</p>

<p>This process has given result in cases where none were
obtained by Mistcherlich's method. It possesses, moreover,
an advantage over the latter process, in not being influenced
by the presence of foreign bodies; whereas, in Mistcherlich's
method, some time must elapse before the luminosity of the
vapors becomes apparent if ether or alcohol is contained in
the solutions, and this phenomenon totally fails to appear in
presence of oil of turpentine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<h4>DETECTION OF PHOSPHORUS BY THE USE OF BISULPHIDE OF
CARBON.</h4>

<p>In a report read before the Academy of Sciences in 1856,
presented by an examining commission, of which MM.
<i>Dumas</i>, <i>Pelouze</i> and <i>Claude Bernard</i> were the reporters, the
following results were contained: Phosphorus may remain, in
the <i>free state</i>, in the organs fifteen days after death, and even
then its isolation can easily be accomplished. For this purpose
the stomach or intestines, and the articles of food contained
therein, are cut into pieces and treated with bisulphide
of carbon. Upon filtering the liquid, a solution is obtained
containing all the phosphorus present, which exhibits the
following properties: 1st, When ignited, it burns with a very
luminous flame; 2nd, if allowed to spontaneously evaporate
(the combustion of the phosphorus being prevented by the
organic matter present [<i>Naquet</i>]) an inflammable residue is
obtained, which, if dissolved in boiling monohydrated nitric
acid, gives a solution that, after saturation with ammonia, produces
a precipitate soluble in acids in solutions of barium
salts. If the solution is mixed with perchloride of iron, and
the sesquioxide of this metal subsequently eliminated by the
addition of ammonia, it no longer causes a precipitation in
barium solutions. The fluid acquires a yellow coloration when
boiled with a solution of molybdate of ammonia.</p>

<p>According to our personal experience, the apparatus employed
by Flandin and Danger for the detection of arsenic,
can also be made use of in the examination of the bisulphide
of carbon solution. To this end, the fluid supposed to contain
phosphorus is mixed with perfectly pure alcohol, and the
mixture placed in a small spirit-lamp provided with a very
loose asbestus wick. The lamp is then ignited and the flame
introduced in the combustion tube <i>D</i> (Fig. 11).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a href="images/fig11.jpg"> <img src="images/fig11t.jpg" alt="Fig. 11." title="Fig. 11." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 11.
 </div>
</div>

<p>By the combustion of the mixture, sulphurous, carbonic,
phosphorous acids and water are formed. The water condenses
in <i>c</i>, and, falling into the dish <i>F</i>, carries with it the sulphurous
and phosphorous acids. The acid liquid collected in this way
is evaporated to dryness, some nitric acid added, and the
solution again evaporated. The remaining mass is then dissolved
in water to which some ammonia is added, and the
solution tested for phosphoric acid. This method is an advantageous
one as the phosphoric acid formed must originate
from phosphorus in the <i>free state</i>, and not from any phosphates
which, owing to the presence of organic matter, might be contained
in the bisulphide of carbon solution. It would, however,
lead the analyst into error if the person, supposed to have
been poisoned had eaten cerebral substances or eggs previous
to death, as these contain glycero-phosphoric acid; it is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>fore
advisable to compare the results given by this process with
those obtained by the use of other methods.</p>


<h4>DETECTION OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID.</h4>

<p>Provided free phosphorus has not been detected, it is
necessary to search for phosphorous acid. To this end, the
residue remaining in the flask, in either Mistcherlich's or
Fresenius and Neubauer's method, is introduced into the
apparatus of Dusard and Blondlot. If the phosphorus reaction
appears, it is sufficient; otherwise, its production may
have been hindered by the presence of organic matter. In
case, therefore, the flame is colorless, the evolved gas is conducted
into a neutral solution of nitrate of silver. If the
materials contain phosphorous acid, a precipitate of phosphide
of silver is formed which should be collected and washed.
The precipitate, which is now free from organic matter, is then
examined for phosphorous acid by means of the apparatus of
Dusard and Blondlot.</p>


<h4>ESTIMATION OF PHOSPHORUS.</h4>

<p>The best process for determining quantitatively the amount
of phosphorus present is the one recommended by Fresenius
and Neubauer. The gaseous current is continued until a
fresh nitrate of silver solution is no longer precipitated. The
solution is filtered, the precipitate washed and then dissolved
in nitric acid. The silver is next precipitated by addition of
hydrochloric acid, the fluid again filtered, and the precipitate
well washed. The washings are added to the filtrate, and the
liquid concentrated in a porcelain capsule. A solution of
sulphate of magnesia, containing ammonia, is next added to
the fluid, and the phosphoric acid determined as pyrophosphate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of magnesia: the precipitate formed, is washed, heated to redness,
in order to convert it into the pyrophosphate, and then
weighed.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF ACIDS.</h3>

<p>The search for acids is to be instituted exclusively in the
alimentary canal and its contents. Were acids contained in
the other organs, their presence would be due to the blood in
which they had previously been absorbed, and, as in this case
they would be partially neutralized by the bases contained
in the blood, a conclusive decision in regard to their original
existence in the suspected materials would be impossible, the
salts of the acids usually searched for being normal constituents
of the blood. In order to detect the presence of acids,
the alimentary canal and contents are first boiled with water
which is renewed until the solution ceases to exhibit an acid
reaction when tested with litmus paper. The fluid is then
filtered, alcohol added to the filtrate, in order to precipitate
organic substances, the liquid again filtered, and the solution
tested separately for the various acids as directed below.</p>


<h4>HYDROCHLORIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The solution is placed in a retort provided with a receiver
and distilled until the residual fluid assumes a pasty consistence:
the operation is then discontinued. If hydrochloric
acid be present in the materials under examination, the distillate
will have an acid reaction, and, upon addition of solution
of nitrate of silver, a white precipitate, which is easily
soluble in ammonia but insoluble in nitric acid and in short
possesses all the properties of chloride of silver, will be
formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h4>NITRIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The distillate, obtained as in the preceding process, is
neutralized by the addition of potassa or soda, and evaporated
to dryness. The residue is mixed with copper filings, and
introduced into a glass tube closed at one end and provided
at the other with a cork through which a delivery-tube passes.
Sulphuric acid is then added to the mixture, the cork inserted,
the tube heated, and the evolved vapors conducted into a solution
of protosulphate of iron. The latter solution acquires
a brown coloration which, upon addition of sulphuric acid,
changes to a violet, if nitric acid be present. Upon conducting
the disengaged gas into a solution of narcotine, the latter
acquires a beautiful red color.</p>

<p>Another portion of the residue should deflagrate when
saturated with an alkali and projected upon live coals.</p>


<h4>SULPHURIC ACID.</h4>

<p>In order to detect this acid, the solution obtained by treating
the organs with water is not distilled but is concentrated
to one-sixth of its original volume, and then agitated with
ether for about ten minutes. By this treatment the ether
takes up the free sulphuric acid, but not the acid sulphates
present. After ten minutes contact, the ether is decanted
and allowed to spontaneously evaporate. Upon treating the
residue, which contains the free sulphuric acid and fatty substances,
with water, a solution containing only the sulphuric
acid is obtained. Nitrate of baryta is then added to a portion
of the fluid: in presence of sulphuric acid, a white precipitate,
insoluble in acids, is produced. If this is heated on charcoal before
the blow-pipe, a mass is formed, which, when moistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with hydrochloric acid and placed upon a clean silver coin,
produces a black spot on the metal. Another portion of the
solution is mixed with copper and the mixture evaporated in a
tube closed at one end: sulphurous acid is evolved towards the
end of the operation. This gas is detected by allowing it to
pass over paper saturated with a mixture of iodic acid and
starch; a blue coloration is produced which, owing to the transformation
of the iodine set free into hydriodic acid, subsequently
disappears. (We have never been able to effect the disengagement
of sulphurous acid spoken of above when an exceedingly
dilute sulphuric acid was used, even upon evaporating
the mixture to dryness, notwithstanding Orfila's statement
that the reaction occurs very readily.)</p>


<h4>PHOSPHORIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The aqueous solution is evaporated to dryness, the residue
taken up with alcohol of 44° B., the fluid again evaporated, and
the second residue dissolved in water. Upon adding acetate
of lead to the solution, a white precipitate is produced if phosphoric
acid be present. The precipitate is washed, suspended
in water and a current of sulphuretted hydrogen passed
through the mixture. If the fluid is then filtered, and the excess
of sulphuretted hydrogen expelled from the filtrate by
boiling, a liquid possessing the distinctive properties of a solution
of phosphoric acid will be obtained. This should then be
submitted to the following tests: Some pulverized charcoal is
added to a portion of the solution, the mixture evaporated to
dryness, and the residue obtained introduced into a Hessian
crucible heated to redness: in presence of a considerable
amount of the acid, free phosphorous is liberated and burns
with a bright flame in the upper part of the crucible. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
case this reaction fails to occur, other portions of the fluid are
treated with a solution of a baryta salt, which causes a white
precipitate, soluble in nitric acid; with an ammoniated solution
of sulphate of magnesia, which throws down a crystalline
white precipitate; and by boiling with molybdate of ammonia,
acidulated with nitric acid, which produces a yellow precipitation,
or at least a yellow coloration of the solution.</p>


<h4>OXALIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The solution is subjected to the same treatment as in the
search for phosphoric acid, with the exception that, instead of
adding acetate of lead to the fluid obtained by taking up the
residue left from the alcohol with water, it is divided into two
portions which are examined separately. A solution of a lime
salt is added to one portion: if oxalic acid be present, a precipitate,
which is insoluble in acetic acid or in chloride of
ammonium, and effervesces when slightly calcined and treated
with hydrochloric acid, is formed. Nitrate of silver is added
to the remaining portion of the solution: the formation of a
precipitate, which detonates when dried and heated in a glass
tube closed at one end, is further evidence of the presence
of the acid.</p>


<h4>ACETIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The solution obtained by treating the alimentary canal with
water is distilled, as in testing for nitric and hydrochloric acids,
and the following properties verified in the distillate: 1st. It
has an acid reaction, and possesses the odor of vinegar; 2nd,
unless previously neutralized with a base, it fails to redden the
per-salts of iron; 3rd, if the distillate is added to a solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the per-salts mentioned and sulphuretted hydrogen conducted
through the fluid, a black precipitate is formed; 4th, upon
boiling the still acid fluid with a small quantity of starch, the
property of the latter to become colored in presence of free iodine
is not changed; 5th, if heated with an excess of litharge, a
basic salt which restores the blue color to reddened litmus
paper is produced.</p>


<h4>HYDROCYANIC ACID.</h4>

<p>The detection of hydrocyanic acid requires special precautions.
The substances to be examined are mixed with water,
if solids are present, and introduced into a retort provided
with a delivery-tube which dips in a solution of nitrate of silver.
The retort is then heated over a water-bath. If the
evolved vapors produce a precipitate in the silver solution,
the heating is continued until a fresh portion of the latter is no
longer affected. The operation is now interrupted, hydrochloric
acid added to the retort, and heat again applied.
Should a second precipitation of cyanide of silver occur, the
presence of a <i>cyanide</i> in the suspected materials is indicated;
whereas the formation of a precipitate by the simple action of
heat would point to the presence of free hydrocyanic acid or
cyanide of <span class="locked">ammonium.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8" href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></span> In case the latter compound is present,
ammonia will be contained in the distillate.</p>


<p>In order to identify the cyanogen, a portion of the precipitate
is collected upon a small filter, washed, dried, and then allowed
to fall into a rather long tube, closed at one end, in the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of which some iodine has previously been placed. A column of
carbonate of soda is then introduced above the precipitate for
the purpose of retaining the excess of iodine probably taken.
Upon heating the lower end of the tube, white fumes of iodide
of cyanogen, which condense in needles upon the cold portion
of the tube, are produced. These are easily recognized by aid
of a magnifying glass. They are colorless and are readily volatilized
by heat. Some ammonia is next added to a solution
of protosulphate of iron, the precipitate formed thoroughly
washed, and exposed to the air until it acquires a greenish hue.
The iodide of cyanogen is then withdrawn from the tube and
mixed with potassa-lye and the precipitate mentioned above.
The mixture is evaporated to dryness, the residue obtained
treated with water and the filtered solution then acidulated
with hydrochloric acid. If a solution of a persalt of iron is now
added to the fluid, a blue precipitate is formed. The addition
of salts of copper produces a reddish precipitation.</p>

<p>The remainder of the precipitate formed in the nitrate of
silver solution is heated with sulphur and then boiled with an
aqueous solution of chloride of sodium: if cyanogen is contained
in the precipitate, a solution of sulphocyanate of soda
will be formed, and upon adding sesquichloride of iron an
intense red coloration produced.</p>

<p>It is evident that the presence of another acid in the solution
examined for hydrocyanic acid would render the detection
of <i>cyanides</i> impossible, but in all cases hydrocyanic acid can
be separated without arriving at a decision in regard to its
original state of combination. Nitric, hydrochloric, and several
other acids would not be distilled at the temperature of the
water-bath; an examination for these by the methods already
described can therefore be instituted simultaneously with the
search for hydrocyanic acid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALKALIES AND ALKALINE
EARTHS.</h3>


<p>The separation of these bodies in the caustic state is a
matter of difficulty owing to the great tendency they possess
to become converted into carbonates; the carbonates of lime,
baryta and strontia, moreover, being non-poisonous in their
effects, will not be employed with criminal intent, and the carbonates
of soda and potassa are extensively used as pharmaceutical
preparations. Notwithstanding the small chances
of success, the isolation of the compounds under consideration
in the caustic state is to be attempted.</p>

<p>To this intent, the organs to be analysed, together with their
contents, are placed in a glass retort provided with a receiver,
water added, and the mixture boiled. The distillate will contain
the ammonia present. When, however, putrefaction has
begun, the detection of this compound does not necessarily indicate
its original presence in the suspected materials. If,
after an hour's boiling, the fluid in the retort possess an alkaline
reaction, it is to be examined for soda, potassa, strontia, baryta
and lime. The undistilled solution is filtered, the filtrate
evaporated to dryness, and the residual mass treated with alcohol.
By this treatment, potassa and soda go in solution, lime,
baryta and <span class="locked">strontia<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9" href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></span>&mdash;as well as the alkaline carbonates&mdash;remaining
undissolved. The potassa and soda are separated from
the other salts present by filtering and evaporating the alcoholic
solution to dryness and then calcining the residue in a silver
crucible. The mass, which should still be alkaline, is then
dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid. If the solution is turbid,
traces of baryta or strontia may still be present and should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
removed by filtration. Some hydrochloric acid and solution
of bichloride of platinum are then added to a portion of the filtered
liquid: in presence of <i>potassa</i> a yellow precipitate is formed.</p>


<p>Another portion is treated with tartaric acid: a white granular
precipitate is produced. Hydrofluosilicic acid is added to
a third portion of the solution: the formation of a gelatinous
precipitate is a further indication of the presence of potassa.
If the preceding tests have given negative results, and a white
precipitate is formed by the addition of antimonate of potassa
to another portion of the solution, <i>soda</i> is present. In both
cases, it is necessary to confirm the results by means of the
spectroscope.</p>

<p>The above reactions are distinctive only in the absence of
metals precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphide of ammonium
or carbonate of soda, and small portions of the solution
should be tested with these reagents.</p>

<p>In order to detect baryta, strontia and lime, the residue,
insoluble in alcohol is dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and an
excess of carbonate of ammonia added to the solution: the
three bases, if present, are precipitated as carbonates. The
precipitate formed is separated from the solution by filtration,
dissolved on the filter in dilute hydrochloric acid, and the
solution then filtered and divided into two parts: sulphuric
acid is added to one, the fluid filtered from the precipitate of
sulphate of baryta formed, and the filtrate treated with ammonia
and oxalate of ammonia. If <i>lime</i> be present,&mdash;although its
sulphate is not easily soluble&mdash;sufficient will be contained in
the filtrate to give a white precipitate of oxalate of lime.</p>

<p>The remaining portion of the solution is evaporated to dryness,
and the residue treated with absolute alcohol. Chloride
of strontium goes into solution, chloride of barium remaining
undissolved. If upon evaporating the alcoholic solution a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
residue is obtained which, when dissolved in water, produces
turbidity in a solution of sulphate of lime, <i>strontia</i> is present.</p>

<p>The residue, insoluble in alcohol, is dissolved in water. If
a precipitate is produced by the addition of sulphuric acid or
hydrofluosilicic acid to the solution, <i>baryta</i> is present. The latter
reaction distinguishes baryta from strontia, which is not precipitated
by hydrofluosilicic acid. Should the tests mentioned
above fail to give affirmative results, and poisoning by means of
baryta and strontia be nevertheless suspected, these compounds
may possibly have remained in the materials contained in the
alimentary canal, in the state of insoluble sulphates. To effect
their detection under these circumstances the organic substances
must be decomposed by means of sulphuric acid. The
carbonaceous residue is calcined in a crucible at an elevated
temperature, and the remaining mass treated with water. In
this way, a solution of sulphides of barium and strontium is obtained,
which is then tested as directed above.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF CHLORINE, BROMINE, AND IODINE.</h3>


<h4>CHLORINE AND BLEACHING CHLORIDES.</h4>

<p>The detection of chlorine is very difficult owing to the great
tendency it possesses to become converted into chlorides
or hydrochloric acid, and it is only when found in a free state
that its discovery is of importance.</p>

<p>In case the gas exists uncombined in the alimentary canal,
its odor will be perceptible, and, upon boiling the suspected
materials with water, vapors will be evolved which impart a
blue color to paper saturated with a mixture of iodide of potassium
and starch paste. If the addition of sulphuric acid is
necessary in order to produce the above reactions, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
reason to suspect the presence of "chloride of lime" or <span class="locked">"<i>Eau
de Javelle</i>."<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10" href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></span></p>



<h4>BROMINE.</h4>

<p>In case bromine exists in a free state at the time the autopsy
is made, its presence will be detected by the reddish color
and unpleasant odor it possesses. Its isolation is accomplished
by treating the materials with bisulphide of carbon which,
upon dissolving the bromine, acquires a red color. If potassa
is then added to the solution, it combines with the bromine
and, upon evaporating the decanted fluid, calcining the residue,
and treating it with water, a solution of bromide of potassium
is obtained. Upon adding chlorine-water and ether to a
portion of the fluid, and shaking the mixture, the bromine is
liberated and is dissolved by the ether. The etherial solution
of bromine, which possesses a reddish-yellow color, does not
mingle with, but floats upon the surface of the colorless aqueous
solution.</p>

<p>If nitrate of silver is added to another portion of the
aqueous solution of bromide of potassium, a precipitate of
bromide of silver, soluble in ammonia, is formed.</p>

<p>In case the bromine has been converted into a bromide, it
is necessary to boil the alimentary canal and the articles of
food contained therein with water. The fluid is next filtered
and agitated with chlorine-water and ether. The liberated
bromine is dissolved by the ether, which acquires a reddish-yellow
color. Upon decanting the solution, and treating it
with potassa, bromide of potassium is formed, and can be detected
as directed above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h4>IODINE.</h4>

<p>The detection of iodine is accomplished by a process almost
identical with the above. The isolation of the iodine
having been effected, it remains to be ascertained that it
imparts a blue color to starch paste, and a violet color to
bisulphide of carbon.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF METALS.</h3>

<p>Under this head we will indicate the systematic course of
analysis to be pursued, supposing a mixture of several metals
including arsenic and antimony, to be under examination.</p>

<p>The organic substances are first destroyed by means of
chlorate of potassa and hydrochloric acid. When this is accomplished,
the excess of chlorine is removed by boiling and
the liquid filtered. The portion remaining on the filter is
preserved: it contains all the silver and a large portion of the
lead, if these metals are present. We will designate the residue
as A, the filtrate as B.</p>


<h4>TREATMENT OF RESIDUE A.</h4>

<p>The residue is calcined with a little carbonate of soda and
cuttings of pure Swedish filtering paper, the chlorides present
being reduced to the metallic state by this treatment. The
residue is next taken up with water acidulated with nitric
acid, and the solution filtered. An insoluble residue, that
may remain, is washed with hot water until the wash-water
ceases to precipitate solution of nitrate of silver, and dried.
It is then dissolved in boiling nitric acid, the solution diluted
with water, and <span class="locked">filtered.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11" href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<p>Sulphuric acid is added to the filtrate: if no precipitate
forms, the absence of <i>lead</i>, in the residue A, is indicated.
If, on the contrary, a precipitate is produced, it is collected
upon a filter and washed. In order to make sure that the precipitate
consists of sulphate of lead, it is treated with a solution
of tartrate of ammonia: it should dissolve, forming a solution
in which sulphuretted hydrogen produces a black precipitate.</p>

<p>The fluid which has failed to be precipitated by the addition
of sulphuric acid, or the filtrate separated from the precipitate
formed, can contain only silver. Upon adding hydrochloric
acid, this metal is thrown down as a caseous white precipitate,
which is soluble in ammonia, but insoluble in boiling
nitric acid, and blackens upon protracted exposure to light.
The formation of a precipitate possessing these properties,
leaves no doubt as to the presence of <i>silver</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;In the operations described above, as well as in
those following, the difficulty in separating minute precipitates
from the filter is often experienced. When the precipitate is
to be dissolved in reagents that do not affect the paper, such
as ammonia, tartrate of ammonia, and dilute acids, it can be
brought in solution directly on the filter. In cases, however,
where reagents which attack the paper are employed, the
precipitate should be separated. This is accomplished by
mixing a small quantity of pure silica, obtained by the decomposition
of fluoride of silicium by water, with the solution,
before filtering. The precipitate becomes intimately mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the silica, and can then be readily removed from the paper.
The presence of silica does not interfere, it being insoluble in
the reagents commonly made use of.</p>


<h4>TREATMENT OF FILTRATE B.</h4>

<p>A current of sulphuretted hydrogen is conducted for twelve
hours through the solution, which is kept at a temperature of
70°. by means of a water-bath. The flask containing the
liquid is then closed with a piece of paper, and allowed to
remain in a moderately warm place until the odor of the gas
is no longer perceptible. The solution is next filtered with
the precaution mentioned in the preceding remark, and the
precipitate (<i>a</i>) thoroughly washed. The water used in this
operation is united to the filtrate, and the fluid (<i>b</i>) examined
as directed further on.</p>


<h5>TREATMENT OF PRECIPITATE <i>a</i>.</h5>

<p>In order to free the precipitate from the organic substances
possibly present, at the same time avoiding a loss of any
metal, it is dried, moistened with nitric acid, and the mass
heated on a water-bath. Some Swedish filtering paper is next
added, the mixture well impregnated with sulphuric acid, and
then maintained for several hours at a temperature of about
170°. until a small portion (afterwards returned) gives a colorless
solution when treated with water. The residue is now heated
with a mixture of one part of hydrochloric acid and eight
parts of water, the liquid filtered, the matter remaining undissolved
washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, and the washings
united with the filtrate.</p>

<p>The residue <span class="smcap">I.</span> and the solution <span class="smcap">II.</span> are separately examined
as directed below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h5>RESIDUE I.</h5>

<p>This may contain lead, mercury, tin, bismuth and antimony.
It is heated for a considerable time with <i>aqua regia</i>, the
solution filtered, and the second residue, should one remain,
washed with dilute hydrochloric acid. If the second residue
is fused with cyanide of potassium, the compounds present are
reduced to the metallic state. The liberated metals are treated
with nitric acid, which dissolves <i>lead</i>, but leaves <i>tin</i> as insoluble
metastannic acid. The nitrate of lead is then filtered from
the metastannic acid, and both metals are identified as described
in the treatment of residue A.</p>

<p>The solution, obtained by the action of <i>aqua regia</i> on residue
I, is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen. The tin and antimony
are separated from the lead, mercury and bismuth by
treating the precipitate produced with sulphide of ammonium,
which dissolves only the sulphides of the first two metals.
The solution in sulphide of ammonium is afterwards examined
for these metals, as directed under the head of solution IV.,
the search for arsenic, however, being here omitted.</p>

<p>Upon treating the residue insoluble in sulphide of ammonium
with nitric acid, lead, copper and bismuth go into solution,
mercury remaining undissolved. The liquid is filtered,
and the undissolved mercury submitted to the special examination
previously described.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid is added to the solution and the precipitate
of sulphate of lead formed, separated, washed, and examined
as directed while treating of residue A.</p>

<p>Finally, the solution separated from the lead is tested for
<i>bismuth</i> and <i>copper</i>, as in examination of precipitate III.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h5>SOLUTION II.</h5>

<p>The solution is concentrated by heating on a water-bath, a
small quantity of carbonate of soda cautiously added to a portion,
and notice taken if a precipitate forms. The part taken
is then acidulated with a little hydrochloric acid, returned to the
principal solution, and sulphuretted hydrogen conducted through
the fluid, as in the examination of solution B. In case a precipitate
fails to form, all metals are absent; if, on the contrary,
a precipitate (<i>c</i>) is produced, it is examined as directed below.</p>

<h5>EXAMINATION OF PRECIPITATE <i>c</i>.</h5>

<p>If the solution merely became turbid, or the precipitate
formed was of a pure white color, it consists probably
of sulphur. It is, however, indispensable, even in this
case, to collect the precipitate and examine it for <i>arsenic</i>.
Provided it is of a pure yellow color, it is treated with ammonia.
In case it is entirely dissolved by this treatment, and the
addition of carbonate of ammonia failed to produce a precipitate
in solution II., it is certain that arsenic, and no other
metal, is present. Under these circumstances, the ammoniacal
solution is examined as directed in the article on the
detection of arsenic. If, on the other hand, the precipitate is
not yellow, or being yellow, is but imperfectly soluble in ammonia,
and a precipitate was formed by the addition of carbonate
of ammonia to solution II., it is necessary to likewise
search for tin, antimony, mercury, copper, bismuth and cadmium.
In this case, the precipitate is placed in a small flask,
allowed to digest for several hours with ammonia and sulphide
of ammonium in a moderately warm place, and the solution filtered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining residue (III.) is washed, labelled, and preserved
for subsequent examination; the <i>filtrate</i> (IV.) is treated
as directed below.</p>


<h5>TREATMENT OF SOLUTION IV.</h5>

<p>The solution, to which the water used in washing the residue
has been added, is evaporated to dryness, the residue
obtained taken up with pure fuming nitric acid, and the liquid
again evaporated. The second residue is next saturated with
a solution of carbonate of soda. A mixture of 1 part of carbonate
and 2 of nitrate of soda is then added, the mixture
evaporated to dryness, and the residual mass heated to fusion.
The fused mass, when cold, is treated with cold water, and any
remaining residue washed with a mixture of equal parts of alcohol
and water. The filtered fluids are now evaporated in order
to remove the alcohol, sulphuric acid is then added, and the
mixture heated until white fumes of the acid begin to evolve. In
this way the complete expulsion of the nitric acid present is
rendered certain. When cold, the residue is treated with water
and the <i>solution</i> introduced into Marsh's apparatus, or, in
case a quantitative estimation of the arsenic is desired, it is
treated with sulphuretted hydrogen and the weight of the precipitate
formed determined, as directed under the detection of
arsenic.</p>

<p>Should a residue insoluble in water remain, it may contain
tin, antimony and traces of copper. Upon dissolving it in <i>aqua
regia</i> and placing a sheet of pure zinc in the solution, these
metals are thrown down in the metallic state. The precipitate
is collected, the zinc present completely removed by treatment
with <i>dilute</i> hydrochloric acid, and the residue boiled with concentrated
hydrochloric acid which dissolves the <i>tin</i> present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The fluid is filtered and the <i>filtrate</i> tested for this metal by
adding solution of chloride of gold, which, in its presence, produces
a purple precipitate, and, by treating it with sulphurated
hydrogen, which forms a brown precipitate, soluble in sulphide
of ammonium.</p>

<p>If the <i>residue</i>, insoluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid,
is thoroughly washed and then treated with nitric acid, the
copper present goes in solution. The fluid is filtered, and ammonia
added to the filtrate: in presence of <i>copper</i>, the solution
acquires a blue color, and gives a reddish precipitate upon addition
of ferrocyanide of potassium.</p>

<p><i>Antimony</i>, if present, remains by the treatment with nitric
acid as an insoluble intermediate oxide. This is dissolved in
hydrochloric acid, in which it is now soluble, and the solution
introduced into Marsh's apparatus.</p>


<h5>TREATMENT OF PRECIPITATE III.</h5>

<p>This precipitate may contain the sulphides of mercury, copper,
cadmium and bismuth. Upon treating it with nitric acid,
all but the sulphide of mercury are dissolved. In case no residue
remains, the absence of <i>mercury</i> is indicated; if, on the
other hand, a residue is left, it is well washed, dissolved in
<i>aqua regia</i>, and the solution examined, either by means of
Smithson's pile, or in the apparatus of Flandin and Danger.
(<i>Vide <a href="#DETECTION_OF_MERCURY">Detection of Mercury</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>Whether a residue remains or not, an excess of ammonia
is next added to the filtered solution in nitric acid: the formation
of a permanent precipitate denotes the presence of <i>bismuth</i>.
In this case, the fluid is filtered, and the alkaline filtrate
further tested for copper and cadmium. For this purpose, cyanide
of potassium is added, and sulphuretted hydrogen con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>ducted
through the filtrate: if <i>cadmium</i> be present, a yellow
precipitate is produced, copper not being thrown down in presence
of an alkaline cyanide. The precipitate of sulphide of
cadmium is separated from the solution by filtration, and the
filtrate saturated with hydrochloric acid. <i>Copper</i>, if present,
is now precipitated as sulphide: its separation is completed
by conducting sulphuretted hydrogen through the fluid.</p>

<p>The precipitate is collected, washed, dissolved in nitric acid,
and its identity established as previously directed. If the
metal be present in sufficient quantity, it should be obtained
in a metallic state upon a plate of iron; it is then coherent,
possesses its natural color, and can conveniently be exhibited
to the Jury.</p>


<h5>TREATMENT OF SOLUTION <i>b</i>.</h5>

<p>This solution may contain: cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese,
chromium, zinc and aluminium. Of these, only zinc and
chromium are poisonous; the search for these two metals is
therefore all that is necessary in criminal cases. The solution
is treated with a slight excess of ammonia, sulphide of ammonium
added, and the fluid, after being allowed to stand for
several hours, filtered. The precipitate may consist of sulphide
of zinc and hydrated oxide of chromium, as well as of
traces of sulphide of iron and phosphate of lime. If the suspected
materials contained a <i>chromate</i>, this salt, in presence
of hydrochloric acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, would be converted
into sesquichloride of chromium a compound which is
precipitated by sulphide of ammonium as a hydrated oxide.</p>

<p>The precipitate is washed with water, to which a little
sulphide of ammonium is added, then dried, and fused with
four times its weight of a mixture of equal parts of carbonate
and nitrate of potassa. After the mass has remained in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
state of fusion for a quarter of an hour, it is treated with
boiling water, mixed with a little alcohol, in order to decompose
the manganate that would be present were manganese contained
in the materials under examination. The alcohol is
then expelled by boiling the fluid, and the solution filtered.
The <i>filtrate</i> may contain phosphate of potassa, originating
from the phosphate of lime present, and <i>chromate of potassa</i>,
resulting from the oxidation of the sesquioxide of chromium.
In presence of the latter compound, the following reactions
will occur in the solution: 1st., Upon acidulation with acetic
acid and addition of solution of acetate of lead, a yellow
precipitate, soluble in potassa, is formed; 2nd., if hydrochloric
acid is added and sulphuretted hydrogen conducted into the
solution, the latter acquires a green color, and, upon adding
ammonia, a bluish-grey precipitate of chromic hydrate is
produced; 3rd., if nitrate of silver is added to the solution,
a brick-red precipitate is formed.</p>

<p>The <i>precipitate</i> remaining on the filter, may consist of
zinc, mixed with the oxides of iron, nickel, cobalt, aluminium
and manganese. It is dissolved in boiling hydrochloric acid,
acetate of soda added, and the fluid boiled until no further
precipitation occurs. The iron is now completely separated.
The solution is then filtered, the precipitate washed, and an
excess of potassa added to the <i>filtrate</i>; if the solution contains
cobalt, nickel or manganese&mdash;which is improbable&mdash;a permanent
precipitate is formed. This is separated from the fluid by
filtration: its further examination is, however, unnecessary, as
the metals of which it consists are not poisonous. The
<i>filtrate</i> may contain aluminium and <i>zinc</i>. The latter metal is
detected by acidulating the filtrate with acetic acid, and adding a
solution of sulphuretted hydrogen: in presence of zinc a white
precipitate of its sulphide is formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>In case organic substances are present, the precipitation of
chromium by sulphide of ammonium may possibly have been
hindered, and the metal have passed into the filtrate. When,
therefore, chromium is not detected in the precipitate, the
filtrate should also be examined. For this purpose, the fluid
is evaporated to dryness, and the residue obtained fused with
a mixture of nitrate and carbonate of soda. The fused mass
is then taken up with water, the solution acidulated with
acetic acid, and a solution of acetate of lead added: if
chromium be present, a yellow precipitate, soluble in potassa,
is produced.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF ALKALOIDS AND SOME ILL-DEFINED
ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12" href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
</h3>

<p>A general method for effecting the detection of alkaloids
was first proposed by <i>Stas</i>. Since the publication of this
method, modifications to it have been recommended by <i>Otto</i>,
and by <i>L. Uslar</i> and <i>J. Erdman</i>. Other processes have
been suggested by <i>Rodgers</i> and <i>Girwood</i>, by <i>E. Prollius</i>, and
by <i>Graham</i> and <i>Hofman</i>. The latter will doubtless become
general in their application; but up to the present time they
have been employed exclusively in the detection of strychnine.
Dialysis has also been recently applied in the separation of
alkaloids.</p>



<h4>STAS'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>This method is based upon the facts: (<i>a</i>), that the acid salts
of the alkaloids, especially those containing an excess of tar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>taric
or oxalic acids, are decomposed by caustic alkalies and
by the bicarbonates of soda and potassa; (<i>b</i>), that the alkaloids,
when liberated in this manner, are combined with a certain
amount of water which determines their solution in ether,
although, in a desiccated state they may be insoluble in this
menstruum; (<i>c</i>), that they may be extracted from their aqueous
solutions by agitation with ether.</p>

<p>Stas's original method is as follows: The suspected substances,
if organs are contained, are cut into fine shreds, then
mixed with absolute alcohol, 0.5 to 2. grammes of tartaric or
oxalic acid added and the whole introduced into a flask and
heated at a temperature of 60° to 75°. When quite cold,
the mixture is filtered, and the undissolved portion remaining
on the filter washed with absolute alcohol, the washings being
added to the filtrate. The alcoholic solution is evaporated,
either by placing it under a bell-jar connected with an air-pump,
or by passing a current of air, having a temperature not
exceeding 35° over it, until reduced to a quarter of its original
volume: the complete expulsion of the alcohol being then
rendered certain. If insoluble matter separates during this
operation, the concentrated fluid is passed through a moistened
filter, the water used in washing the residue being united to
the filtrate which is then evaporated to dryness by aid of the
air-pump or by placing the fluid in a bell-jar over concentrated
sulphuric acid. When the evaporation is completed, the
residue is treated with absolute alcohol, the alcohol allowed to
evaporate at the ordinary temperature of the air, and the
second residue dissolved in the smallest possible amount of
water. The fluid thus obtained is placed in a test-tube, and a
concentrated solution of bicarbonate of soda added so long
as effervescence takes place. Ether is then added, the mixture
thoroughly shaken, and after it has remained at rest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
some time, a small portion of the supernatant ether removed
and evaporated on a watch-glass: the residue obtained will
consist of the alkaloid present. Two cases are now possible:
the alkaloid is a solid, or it is a liquid and is volatile.</p>

<p>The further treatment of the solution is modified according
to these circumstances.</p>


<h5><i>a.</i> THE ALKALOID IS LIQUID AND VOLATILE.</h5>

<p>If, upon the evaporation of the ether, oily streaks were
left on the watch-glass, a volatile alkaloid is probably present.</p>

<p>In this case, a solution of caustic potassa is added to the
test-tube, the mixture shaken, the supernatant ether <span class="locked">decanted<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13" href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></span>
into a flask and the remaining solution again washed with
ether until the last portion fails to leave a residue upon
evaporation. The etherial fluids are then united, and two
cubic centimetres of water, acidulated with one-fifth of its
weight of sulphuric acid, added. This acid retains the alkaloid,
which is now in the state of a pure acid-sulphate soluble
in water, the animal matters present remaining dissolved in
the ether. The ether, in which some sulphate of conia may
be contained&mdash;although the greater portion of this compound
would remain in the aqueous solution&mdash;is then decanted. The
remaining aqueous solution of the pure sulphate of the alkaloid
is placed in a test-tube, a solution of caustic potassa and
some ether added, and the mixture well shaken. The ether
is next decanted and allowed to spontaneously evaporate in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dry place at a very low temperature, and the ammonia possibly
present is then removed by placing the vessel containing the
residue over sulphuric acid. The residue now obtained consists
of the alkaloid present in a state of purity, and can
be directly identified by means of the reactions described further
on.</p>


<h5><i>b.</i> THE ALKALOID IS SOLID.</h5>

<p>It sometimes occurs that ether fails to take up all of the
alkaloid present in the fluid treated with bicarbonate of soda.
Under these circumstances the fluid should be mixed with
caustic potassa, the mixture shaken, and the ether decanted;
this operation being repeated several times, until the entire
amount of the alkaloid is removed; the ethereal fluids are then
united in a capsule, and allowed to spontaneously evaporate.
The result of the evaporation may be solid; more frequently,
however, a milky liquid remains which restores the blue color
to reddened litmus paper; if so, the presence of a vegetable
alkaloid is certain. In order to purify the residue,
a few drops of water, slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid,
are added to the capsule, and the latter turned, so as to bring
the fluid in contact with the substance at all points; in this
manner a colorless and limpid fluid is obtained, the fatty
substances adhering to the dish. The liquid is decanted into
a second capsule, the remaining residue washed with a little
acidulated water, and the washings likewise added to the
principal solution. The fluid is now evaporated either <i>in
vacuo</i>, or over sulphuric acid, to about three-fourths of its
original volume a concentrated solution of neutral carbonate
of potassa added, and the mixture treated with absolute
alcohol, which dissolves the liberated alkaloid, and separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
it from the sulphate of potassa formed and the excess of
carbonate of potassa. The alcoholic solution is decanted and
allowed to evaporate <i>in vacuo</i> or in the air: the alkaloid now
crystallizes out in a state suitable for further examination.</p>


<h4>MODIFICATIONS TO STAS'S METHOD, PROPOSED BY OTTO.</h4>

<p>In Stas's method, the loss of morphine is possible, for, if
ether is not added immediately after the addition of carbonate
of soda, this alkaloid crystallizes and is then no longer soluble
in that menstruum; and, if the ethereal solution is not quickly
decanted, the portion dissolved will likewise separate out in
small crystals. In both cases, morphine will remain in the
aqueous solution from which the other alkaloids have been
extracted by the ether. <i>M. Otto</i> recommends the addition of
chloride of ammonium and a little soda-lye, in order to dissolve
the alkaloid. Upon allowing the solution so obtained
to stand for some time exposed to the air, crystals of morphine
are deposited.</p>

<p>According to the same authority, it is advisable to omit
the distinction drawn by Stas between volatile and fixed
alkaloids, and submit both to the treatment recommended for
those that are volatile.</p>

<p>Otto also recommends the agitation of the fluid containing
the oxalates or tartrates of the alkaloids with ether, previously
to their separation by means of bicarbonate of soda.
By this treatment the elimination of the coloring matter present&mdash;as
well as of <i>colchicine</i>, <i>digitaline</i>, <i>picrotoxine</i>, traces of
<i>atropine</i>, and various impurities&mdash;is accomplished. As soon
as the ether ceases to become colored and to leave a residue
upon evaporation, alkali is added, and the operation concluded
as usual. In this way the alkaloid is obtained, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
directly, in a pure condition. This last modification appears
to us to be a very happy one, inasmuch as it greatly facilitates
the purification of the alkaloid present.</p>


<h4>MODIFICATIONS TO STAS'S METHOD, PROPOSED BY USLAR AND
ERDMAN.</h4>

<p>1st. The materials to be examined are brought to the consistence
of a thin paste, and digested for about two hours
with water, to which some hydrochloric acid has been added,
at a temperature of 60° to 80°. The mixture is then filtered
through a moistened linen cloth, and the residue washed with
warm acidulated water; the washings being added to the
solution.</p>

<p>2nd. Some pure quartz sand&mdash;or, preferably, silica prepared
by the decomposition of fluoride of silicium&mdash;is added to the
filtrate, the fluid supersaturated with ammonia, and evaporated
to dryness over a water-bath: the addition of silica renders
the residue friable.</p>

<p>3rd. The residue is boiled repeatedly with amylic alcohol,
which extracts all the alkaloid present as well as the fatty
and coloring matters, and the extracts filtered through filter
paper that has been moistened with amylic alcohol.</p>

<p>4th. The filtered fluid is thoroughly agitated with ten or
twelve times its volume of almost boiling water acidulated
with hydrochloric acid: the hydrochlorate of the alkaloid present
goes into the aqueous solution, the fatty and coloring
substances remaining dissolved in the oily supernatant layer.
The latter is separated by means of a pipette, and the acid
aqueous solution shaken with fresh quantities of amylic
alcohol until completely decolorized.</p>

<p>5th. The aqueous solution is then concentrated, ammonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
added, and the mixture well shaken with warm amylic alcohol,
in which the alkaloid dissolves. As soon as the solution
forms a supernatant layer upon the surface of the fluid, it is
drawn off with a pipette and evaporated on a water-bath. In
this manner, the alkaloid is usually obtained in a sufficient
state of purity to admit of its immediate identification; if,
however, a small portion turns brown when treated with concentrated
sulphuric acid, the process of purification must be
repeated. Under these circumstances it is re-dissolved in
dilute hydrochloric acid, the solution repeatedly shaken with
amylic alcohol, in order to extract the impurities present, and
the alkaloid then extracted with ammonia and amylic alcohol,
as previously directed.</p>

<p>The method of <i>von Uslar</i> and <i>Erdman</i> differs from that of
Stas merely in the substitution of amylic alcohol for ether,
and of hydrochloric acid for oxalic or tartaric acid. It offers
no advantages over Stas's method if the alkaloids present are
soluble in ether but is even less advantageous in this case,
inasmuch as its execution requires a longer time. In cases
where the detection of morphine, or an unknown alkaloid, is
desired, the use of amylic alcohol instead of ether is, it is
true, preferable; still, with the exercise of care, ether can also
be employed, and, as this process greatly facilitates examinations
when no clew to the poison present exists and all alkaloids
may possibly be absent, we prefer it to the one just
described.</p>


<h4>RODGERS AND GIRDWOOD'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>This method&mdash;which as yet has only been employed in
the detection of strychnine&mdash;is based upon the solubility of this
alkaloid in chloroform. The substances under examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are digested with dilute hydrochloric acid, and the mixture
filtered. The filtrate is then evaporated to dryness on the
water-bath, the residue taken up with pure alcohol, the alcoholic
solution evaporated, the second residue treated with
water, and the solution so obtained filtered. The filtrate is
next supersaturated with ammonia, and well shaken with
chloroform, which, upon being separated by means of a pipette
and evaporated, leaves the alkaloid in an impure state. Concentrated
sulphuric acid is then poured upon the alkaloid:
the latter is not affected by this treatment, whereas the foreign
organic substances present are carbonized. After the lapse
of several hours, the mixture is treated with water, the fluid
filtered, and the strychnine extracted from the filtrate by means
of ammonia and chloroform, as already described. The operation
is repeated until the residue obtained by evaporating
the chloroform is no longer affected by the treatment with sulphuric
acid.</p>


<h4>PROLLIUS'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>The suspected substances are boiled with aqueous alcohol,
mixed with tartaric acid, and evaporated at a gentle heat. The
remaining aqueous solution is then passed through a moistened
filter, ammonia added to the filtrate, and the mixture shaken
with chloroform. The chloroform is separated, the last trace
of the original solution removed by washing with water, three
parts of alcohol added, and the fluid evaporated. If strychnine
be present, it will now separate out in crystals. This
method is applicable only in presence of a considerable quantity
of strychnine, and is less serviceable than the one preceding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h4>GRAHAM AND HOFMAN'S METHOD.</h4>

<p>This method, which is applied to the detection of strychnine
in beer, is founded upon the fact that an aqueous solution of a
strychnine salt yields the alkaloid to animal charcoal, from
which it can be subsequently extracted by boiling with
alcohol. The beer to be examined is shaken with 30 grammes
of animal charcoal, and the mixture then allowed to stand
twenty-four hours, with occasional shaking. The solution is
next filtered, the animal charcoal washed with water, and
boiled for half-an-hour with four times its weight of 90 per
cent. alcohol. The apparatus represented in Fig. 12 is employed,
in order to avoid a loss of substance in this operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a href="images/fig12.jpg"> <img src="images/fig12t.jpg" alt="Fig. 12." title="Fig. 12." /></a>
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 12.
 </div>
</div>

<p>The alcohol is filtered hot, evaporated, and the residue
obtained treated with a small quantity of solution of potassa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and then agitated with ether. Upon spontaneous evaporation,
the ethereal solution leaves the strychnine present in a comparatively
pure state.</p>

<p><i>Macadam</i> proposes to use this process for the detection of
strychnine in animal bodies. For this purpose, the suspected
materials are heated with a solution of oxalic acid, as in Stas's
method, and the strychnine detected in the filtered solution in
the manner just described. This method is scarcely to be recommended:
the use of animal charcoal is doubtless serviceable
in the examination of beer, as it effects the separation of a small
amount of strychnine from a large quantity of fluid, but its
application to other researches is much less to be advised.</p>


<h4>APPLICATION OF DIALYSIS IN THE DETECTION OF ALKALOIDS.</h4>

<p>In order to apply the dialytic method to the separation of
alkaloids, the suspected substances are heated with hydrochloric
acid, and the solution introduced into the dialyzer. The
hydrochlorates of the alkaloids, being crystalline bodies,
transverse the membrane, and are contained, for the greater
part, after twenty-four hours, in the outer solution. The
fluid is then concentrated, and the alkaloids either directly
precipitated, or purified by one of the preceding methods.</p>


<h4>IDENTIFICATION OF THE ALKALOID.</h4>

<p>The alkaloid having been isolated by one of the preceding
methods, it remains to establish its identity. Owing to
the small number of reactions characteristic of organic compounds,
this is a matter of considerable difficulty. There
are two cases possible: the alkaloid may either be volatile or
fixed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h5>THE ALKALOID IS VOLATILE.</h5>

<p>In this case it may consist of nicotine, conine or aniline:
less known alkaloids (piccoline, etc.) may also be present.
We will confine ourselves to the consideration of the three first
mentioned.</p>

<p>The alkaloid is divided into several portions which are
placed on watch-glasses and submitted to the following tests:</p>

<p class="restr"><i>a.</i> A drop is treated with nitric acid: this may,
or may not, impart a red tint to the alkaloid; if
it does, another drop is treated with dry hydrochloric
acid gas: if it assumes a deep violet color,
it probably consists of <span  class="flr"><i>conine</i>.</span></p>

<p class="restr"><i>b.</i> In case a red color was not produced by the
addition of nitric acid, another drop is treated with
chloride of lime. If it acquires a violet tint, and
two other drops, when heated, one with arsenic acid,
the other with nitrate of mercury, become red, the
body present consists of <span  class="flr"><i>aniline</i>.</span>
<br />or an homologous base.</p>

<p class="restr"><i>c.</i> Should the above tests fail to give positive
results, and the substance, when treated
with chlorine, assumes a blood-red color, and
with hydrochloric acid does not change in the
cold but turns to a deep violet color upon boiling,
it probably consists of <span class="flr"><i>nicotine</i>.</span></p>


<h5>THE ALKALOID IS FIXED.</h5>

in an excess of the precipitant, is immediately formed;
(<i>b</i>) a precipitate is formed, which, at first dissolves, but is
subsequently deposited from the fluid; (<i>c</i>) no precipitate is
produced, or, in case one forms, it dissolves in an excess of

<p>A small quantity of an aqueous solution of carbonic acid

on a water-bath to dryness, in order to avoid a loss of
substance.</p>

<h4>IDENTIFICATION OF DIGITALINE, PICROTOXINE AND COLCHICINE.</h4>

<p>It has already been remarked that in exhausting the first
acid solution with ether&mdash;previous to the neutralization, ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>cording
to Otto's method&mdash;colchicine, a weak alkaloid, digitaline,
an indefinite mixture, picrotoxine (which appears to possess
the properties of an acid), and traces of atropine, pass into
solution.</p>

<p>The ether is evaporated on a water-bath to dryness, the
residuary mass treated with slightly warmed water and the
solution filtered from the undissolved resinous matter. The
aqueous solution is next rendered feebly alkaline by addition
of soda lye, and then well agitated with ether, until this fluid
ceases to leave a residue upon evaporation. The ethereal solution
is now decanted, and the water present removed by
means of chloride of calcium. If it is evaporated, a residue
containing the <i>colchicine</i>, <i>digitaline</i> and traces of atropine
(mixed possibly with a minute quantity of picrotoxine, which is
here left out of consideration) is obtained.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>alkaline solution</i>, from which the ether has been removed,
is acidulated with hydrochloric acid and again shaken
with ether. The <i>picrotoxine</i> present is now dissolved, and
upon dehydrating (by means of fused chloride of sodium)
and evaporating the ethereal solution can be obtained in
crystals. The crystals of picrotoxine are easily recognized
by their forming in feathery tufts as well as by their length
and silky brilliancy. Should crystals fail to form in a short
time, it is advisable to take up the residue, left by the evaporations
of the ether, with slightly warmed alcohol, and to allow
the latter to spontaneously evaporate on a watch-glass, or, if
the quantity of substance is exceedingly minute, on the slide
of a microscope. After determining the form of the crystals,
it should be ascertained that they possess an intense bitter
taste and exhibit the other characteristic properties of picrotoxine.
The following reaction is distinctive: If the crystals
are dissolved in an aqueous solution of soda and a few drops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of "Fehling's <span class="locked">solution"<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15" href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></span> added, a reddish precipitate of cuprous
oxide is formed.</p>


<p><i>b.</i> Provided picrotoxine has not been found, the <i>ethereal solution</i>
obtained by agitating the alkaline fluid with ether is to
be examined for colchicine and digitaline. To this end, the
residue obtained upon evaporating the solution to dryness is
taken up with water, and the filtered fluid tested as follows:
1. It is ascertained if a drop of the solution possesses the
bitter taste of digitaline. 2. Another drop is treated with solution
of tannin; if either alkaloid be present, a precipitate is
formed. 3. Two drops of the solution are next tested: one
with tincture of iodine, the other with chloride of gold. These
reagents precipitate colchicine, but do not affect solutions of
digitaline or picrotoxine. Unfortunately traces of atropine, possibly
present, would cause the same reaction; the test therefore
fails to be conclusive. 4. Several portions of the solution
are evaporated on watch crystals. Concentrated nitric acid is
added to one portion: if colchicine be present, an evanescent
violet coloration is produced, which changes to a light yellow
upon addition of water, and to a pure yellow or reddish-orange
color, if the mixture is saturated with a slight excess of caustic
alkali. 5. Another portion of the residue is dissolved in a few
drops of concentrated sulphuric acid, and the solution stirred with
a glass rod moistened with bromine water: in presence of digitaline
a violet-red color is produced. This coloration is more distinct
when a small quantity of the alkaloid and an excess of sulphuric
acid are present. 6. If a large amount of substance is at
hand, the residue can be boiled with hydrochloric acid, and the
green or brownish color and characteristic odor of digitaline pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>duced,
in case this body be present: this, however, is not a very
delicate test. 7. Finally; it is advisable when the presence of digitaline
is suspected to ascertain its physiological action. For this
purpose, a minute quantity of the substance is placed upon the
heart of a frog: in presence of the alkaloid, the pulsations are
immediately retarded, or even arrested.</p>

<hr class="hr45" />

<p>Although by means of the tests given above the existence
of a special alkaloid, or of one of the ill-defined substances just
mentioned, may be justly regarded as probable, its presence has
not yet with certainty been demonstrated. This is especially
true in cases where the compound possesses but few characteristic
properties. When possible, the suspected substance should
be obtained in a crystaline form, and then compared by aid of the
microscope&mdash;if the small quantity present permits of no other examination&mdash;with
crystals of the pure alkaloid, prepared under
the same conditions.</p>

<p>In case 20 or even 10 centigrammes of substance are at hand,
it is best to convert the alkaloid into its hydrochlorate, and
evaporate the solution of this salt to dryness. The residue,
after being weighed, is dissolved in water, and a solution of sulphate
of silver added. The precipitate of chloride of silver
formed is collected and carefully weighed, in order to calculate
the weight of the chlorine contained in the hydrochlorate and
consequently the molecular weight of the alkaloid. The filtrate
from the chloride of silver, which contains the alkaloid in the
state of sulphate, is treated with hydrochloric acid, to remove
the excess of silver present and the fluid then filtered. The filtrate
is next shaken with potassa and ether. Upon decanting and
evaporating the ethereal solution, a residue consisting of the
alkaloid present is obtained, which is then purified by crystallization
from alcohol. An elementary analysis of the alkaloid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
is now executed. <i>Certainty</i> as to the presence of an individual
alkaloid is attainable only when the execution of this confirmatory
test is possible. The reactions previously described can
be performed with fifteen centigrammes of substance, and this
amount is sometimes contained in a cadaver. If but one or
two centigrammes are at hand, it is still possible to detect the
presence of an alkaloid; a conclusion, however, as to <i>which</i> cannot
be arrived at, especially if the substance found is a liquid
or an amorphous body, and one that presents few distinctive
properties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ChIII" id="ChIII">III.<br/>

METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED, WHEN NO CLEW TO THE
NATURE OF THE POISON PRESENT CAN BE
OBTAINED.</a></h2>


<p>If poisoning has been caused by the administration of a
mixture of numerous substances and these greatly differ in
their properties, it is impossible to demonstrate in an incontestible
manner the presence of each individual poison. This
contingency fortunately but seldom arises; the criminal usually
has recourse to one or two poisons, the detection of which is
possible. It must not be imagined, however, that the presence
of a poison in an organ can at once be detected with certainty
by the mere application of a few tests; because, in searching for
a substance which is absent, we may unwittingly destroy the one
present, or, at least, transform it into combinations which would
not allow of a definite conclusion as to its original condition.</p>

<p>In order to follow a systematic method in researches of
this nature, it is advisable to divide the materials under examination
into three parts: one portion is preserved, in order to
ascertain its physiological effects on animals, the chemical analysis
having failed to give positive results. The other portions
are submitted to analysis, but with slightly different objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in view; one is subjected to a series of tests which are adapted,
under all circumstances, to place the chemist on the track
of the poison present, and which, in some cases, may even give
conclusive and definite results. Should these tests furnish only
<i>indications</i> of the nature of the poison, the remaining portion
serves, with the assistance of this information, to establish
beyond doubt the identity of the substance.</p>


<h3>INDICATIVE TESTS.</h3>

<p>Two cases may present themselves: the materials to be
examined possess either an alkaline (or neutral) or an acid
reaction. As the methods to be pursued in either of these
cases differ somewhat, they will be treated separately.</p>


<h4>THE SUBSTANCE POSSESSES AN ACID REACTION.</h4>

<p>The materials are mixed with water, placed in a retort
provided with a delivery-tube which dips in a solution of
nitrate of silver, and heated over a water-bath: if a <i>cyanide</i>
be present, hydrocyanic acid will be disengaged, and a white
precipitate of cyanide of silver formed: this is examined as
previously directed (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>).</p>

<p>In case a precipitate is not produced by the above treatment,
more water is added to the retort, and the mixture
boiled for about an hour, care being taken to collect the
evolved vapors in a well-cooled receiver. The portion remaining
in the retort is thrown on a filter and the filtrate obtained
united with the distillate. The residue remaining on the
filter is next washed with boiling absolute alcohol, the
washings being added to the aqueous solution. In this way,
the suspected substances are divided into soluble and insolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>ble
portions, which are examined separately, as directed
below.</p>


<h5><i>a.</i> LIQUID PORTION.</h5>

<p>If the addition of alcohol caused a precipitation of animal
matters, these are separated by filtering the solution. The
filtrate is then placed under a bell-jar over concentrated
sulphuric acid until its volume is considerably reduced. The
solution may contain organic and inorganic bases and acids.
In order to detect all bodies that are present, the following
course is pursued:</p>

<p>(1). A current of sulphuretted hydrogen is conducted
through the solution: the precipitation of some metals,
usually thrown down by this gas, may fail to take
place in this instance, owing to the presence of organic
substances; however, some metals are precipitated, even in
presence of organic compounds, and organic acids are but
seldom present. In case a precipitate is formed, it is mixed
with pure silica, collected on a filter, and treated with nitric
acid. If the precipitate fails to dissolve, it is treated with
<i>aqua regia</i>. In either case, the solution obtained is examined
for metals by the ordinary methods.</p>

<p>(2). The solution in which sulphuretted hydrogen failed to
produce a precipitate, or the filtrate separated from the precipitate
formed, is divided into two parts: one portion is
treated with ether and a solution of potassa; the other with
ether and a solution of soda. Both mixtures are then well
agitated, and notice taken if the ether dissolves any thing: if
so, the operation is repeated several times until all soluble
substances are removed. The ethereal solutions are next
decanted and united, and then submitted to the examination
for alkaloids as directed pp. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>-<a href="#Page_84">84</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>(3). If&mdash;the above treatment giving either positive or
negative results&mdash;a precipitate insoluble in ether is formed
by the addition of potassa or soda, it is collected on a filter,
washed, and dissolved in an acid. The solution is then tested
for mineral bases.</p>

<p>(4). In case no definite result has been obtained by the
preceding operations, one of the portions (for instance, the
one to which potassa was added) is tested for the acids possibly
present in the state of salts. The solution is divided into
two parts (A and B) which are examined separately:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portion A.</span>&mdash;This is evaporated to dryness and the residue
divided into four parts which are then tested for hydrofluoric,
nitric, oxalic, and acetic and formic acids.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Hydrofluoric acid.</span>&mdash;A portion of the residue is heated
in a platinum crucible with sulphuric acid, and the crucible
covered with the convex face of a watch-crystal coated with
wax in which lines have been traced with a pointed piece of
wood. If, after gently heating the crucible for some time
and removing the watch-crystal, the lines traced in the wax
are found to be etched in the glass, the substance under examination
contains a <i>fluoride</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Nitric acid.</span>&mdash;If this acid be present, and a second
portion of the residue is heated with sulphuric acid and copper,
reddish-fumes are evolved. Upon conducting the vapors
into a solution of sulphate of iron or narcotine, the reactions
already mentioned in treating of nitric acid take place.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">Oxalic acid.</span>&mdash;The third portion of the residue is heated
with sulphuric acid, and the evolved gas carefully collected. It
should then be confirmed by an elementary analysis that the
gas consists of equal volumes of carbonic oxide and carbonic
acid. This test is not conclusive; it is also necessary to
ascertain if the precipitate produced by the addition of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
baryta solution (<i>vide</i>: under portion <i><a href="#Portion_B">B.</a></i>) produces the same
reaction, inasmuch as other organic bodies could give rise to
carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, and the danger of both
admitting the presence of oxalic acid, when it is absent,
and omitting its detection, in case it is present, would be
incurred.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <span class="smcap">Acetic and Formic acids.</span>&mdash;The fourth portion of
the residue is distilled with dilute sulphuric acid. After
determining that a small portion, previously neutralized with
a base, acquires a red color, upon addition of a solution of a
persalt of iron, the distillate is divided into two parts. One
portion is treated with bichloride of mercury: if <i>formic acid</i>
be present, metallic mercury is formed, with evolution of carbonic
acid which produces turbidity in lime-water. The
remaining portion of the fluid is digested, in the cold, with an
excess of litharge: in presence of <i>acetic acid</i>, a soluble basic
salt of lead, possessing an alkaline reaction, is produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Portion_B" id="Portion_B">Portion B.</a></span>&mdash;The second portion of the solution is supersaturated
with nitric acid, and this neutralized by addition of
a slight excess of ammonia. The ammonia is then expelled
by boiling the fluid, and a solution of nitrate of baryta added.
If a <i>precipitate</i> forms, it is collected and subsequently examined
for sulphuric, phosphoric, oxalic and boric acids as directed
below. The <i>filtrate</i> is preserved and tested for hydrochloric,
hydrobromic and hydriodic acids.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Oxalic acid.</span>&mdash;A portion of the precipitate produced
by the addition of nitrate of baryta is submitted to the test
mentioned under the treatment of portion <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Sulphuric acid.</span>&mdash;If an insoluble residue remains
upon treating the remainder of the precipitate with dilute
hydrochloric acid, it consists of sulphate of baryta and indicates
the presence of <i>sulphuric acid</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">Phosphoric acid.</span>&mdash;An excess of solution of alum and
ammonia is added to the portion of the precipitate dissolved
in hydrochloric acid. If phosphoric acid be present, insoluble
phosphate of alumina is precipitated. This is brought upon
a filter: the <i>filtrate</i> being preserved and subsequently examined
for boric acid. Upon boiling the precipitate with solution of
silicate of potassa, silicate of alumina is thrown down, and
phosphate of potassa remains in solution. Chloride of ammonia
is now added to the liquid&mdash;in order to eliminate the
excess of silica from the silicate&mdash;and the solution filtered.
The <i>filtrate</i> is then tested for phosphates, by means of molybdate
of ammonia (<i>vide</i>: <i>detection of phosphoric acid</i>, p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>).</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <span class="smcap">Boric acid.</span>&mdash;The filtrate from the precipitate of
phosphate of alumina is evaporated to dryness, the residue
mixed with sulphuric acid and alcohol, and the latter ignited.
If the substance contains <i>boric acid</i>, the alcohol will burn with
a <i>green</i> flame.</p>

<p>The <i>filtrate</i>, separated from the precipitate produced by
the addition of nitrate of baryta, may contain hydrochloric,
hydrobromic and hydriodic acids. In order to detect these
compounds, some nitrate of silver is added to the solution, and
the precipitate that may form carefully washed and decomposed
by fusion with potassa. The mass is then dissolved in
water, and the solution submitted to the following tests:</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <span class="smcap">Hydriodic acid.</span>&mdash;Some starch paste and nitric acid&mdash;containing
nitrous acid in solution&mdash;are added to a portion of
the solution: in presence of an <i>iodide</i>, the fluid immediately
acquires a blue color.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> <span class="smcap">Hydrobromic acid.</span>&mdash;In case iodine has not been
detected, chlorine water and ether are added to a second
portion of the fluid, and the mixture well agitated. If <i>bromine</i>
be present, the ether will assume a <i>brown</i> color. In case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
iodine is also contained in the fluid, and the detection of
bromine is desired, it is necessary to acidulate the solution
with hydrochloric acid, and then shake it with chloride of
lime and bisulphide of carbon. The bisulphide of carbon
dissolves the iodine, acquiring a <i>violet</i> color, which disappears
upon a renewed addition of chloride of lime; whereas, in
presence of bromine an <i>orange</i> coloration remains, even after
the disappearance of the iodine reaction.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> <span class="smcap">Hydrochloric acid.</span>&mdash;Since the substance under examination
will already contain hydrochloric acid, it is unnecessary,
in most cases, to institute a search for this compound.
Nevertheless, it may be well to take a quantity of the solution,
corresponding to a known weight of the original substance,
and precipitate the acid by adding nitrate of silver. The
precipitate formed is dried and weighed. It is then heated
in a current of chlorine, in order to completely convert it
into chloride of silver, and its weight again determined. Only
in case the amount of chloride found is very large, is it to be
inferred that the poisoning has been caused by hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> <span class="smcap">Hydrosulphuric acid.</span>&mdash;(<i>Sulphuretted hydrogen</i>). If
the precipitate produced by nitrate of silver possesses a black
color, it may consist of a <i>sulphide</i>. Upon treating a portion
with solution of hyposulphite of soda, all but the sulphide of
silver is dissolved. In case a residue remains, it is calcined
with nitrate of soda, and the sulphate formed detected by
adding a soluble barium salt to its solution.</p>

<p>Sulphates, chlorides, carbonates and phosphates are most
frequently met with in the preceding examination, and it should
be carefully noticed which of these salts exist in the greatest
abundance. If acids of comparatively rare occurrence (such as
the oxalic and tartaric) are found, their approximate amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
is also to be noted. These facts, together with the original
acidity of the materials and the absence of other toxical bodies,
would lead to the conclusion that the poisoning was caused by
the reception of an acid, as well as to the identification of the
special acid used. In subsequently effecting the detection of
the poison by the determinative tests, the danger of destroying
other poisons possibly contained in the substance will be obviated,
as the question of the absence or presence of these latter
will have been previously decided.</p>

<p>(5). The examination for acids concluded, the various fluids
which have accumulated, and from which the acids present
have been separated, are united and the whole evaporated to
dryness. The organic substances, present in the residue obtained,
are destroyed by means of nitric acid, and the residual
mass examined for <i>soda</i>. If this substance has not been introduced
into the portion of fluid examined, and is discovered
in a quantity largely in excess of the amount normally contained
in the organism, it is probable that poisoning has been
caused by its administration, and that an acid has also been
given, either in order to mask the poison, or to act as an antidote.
In this case, it is necessary to carefully search for
acetic acid, as this is the substance usually employed as an
antidote for alkalies.</p>

<p>(6.) Whatever results have been obtained by the preceding
examinations, the portion of the fluid which has been treated
with soda (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>) is evaporated to dryness. The organic
matters possibly present are destroyed by means of
nitric acid, or <i>aqua regia</i>, and the residue taken up with water.
The solution so obtained is then examined for metals (including
potassa, which salt has not been introduced into this portion
of the fluid in any of the preceding operations) by the
usual methods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>(7). The soluble portion of the suspected materials having
been thoroughly tested, the undissolved substances remaining
on the filter are next examined.</p>


<h5><i>b.</i> SOLID PORTION.</h5>

<p>(1). The organic matter present is first destroyed by treatment
with <i>aqua regia</i>. The fluid is then evaporated to dryness,
and the residue heated until the nitric acid is entirely expelled;
the escaping vapors being collected in a cold receiver. The
residue is next taken up with water, the solution filtered, and
sulphuric acid added. Should a precipitate of sulphate of
lime, sulphate of baryta or sulphate of strontia form, it is separated
from the fluid and further examined. The filtered solution
is then introduced into Marsh's apparatus, sodium amalgam
being employed for generating the hydrogen, and tested
for <i>arsenic</i> and <i>antimony</i> by means of the reactions previously
given.</p>

<p>(2). Whether one of the above poisons be discovered or not,
the still acid fluid is removed from the flask, a current of
chlorine conducted through it for several hours and the solution
then examined for <i>mercury</i> by Flandin and Danger's method.
In case mercury is found it could scarcely have originated from
the metal in Marsh's apparatus, as this would not be attacked
by cold dilute sulphuric acid: however, to remove all doubts,
the test should be repeated with a portion of the substances
reserved for the examination by the determinative tests.</p>

<p>(3). Whatever have been the results of the above examinations,
it is still to be ascertained if the fluid, which has been
successively treated by Marsh's and Flandin and Danger's
methods, does not contain other metals. This is accomplished
by means of the ordinary reactions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE SUBSTANCE POSSESSES A NEUTRAL OR AN ALKALINE
REACTION.</h4>

<p>The examination is conducted in precisely the same manner
as in the preceding case, excepting that the materials are first
acidulated with oxalic or tartaric acids. Particular attention
should be given to the search for soda, potassa, lime, baryta
and strontia, and the determinative tests subsequently applied
according to the indications obtained.</p>


<h3>DETERMINATIVE TESTS.</h3>

<p>In many instances the tests we have termed indicative become
determinative in their character. This is the case when
the isolation of an alkaloid or a metal (unless mercury be
found under the circumstances already mentioned) is accomplished;
the results obtained are then <i>conclusive</i>. If, on the
other hand,&mdash;not being able to separate either an alkaloid or a
metal&mdash;upon saturating the originally acid fluid with potassa,
or soda, the salts of these bases have been found in abundance,
there is reason to <i>infer</i> that the poisoning has been
caused by an acid; or, if, after the neutralization of the originally
alkaline solution with an acid, potassa or soda are discovered
in a large quantity, poisoning by an alkali is <i>indicated</i>.</p>

<p>In case the fluid is neutral, but more or less colored and
odoriferous, and iodides or bromides are detected, we may
justly <i>suspect</i> that the poisoning has been caused by the reception
of iodine or bromine.</p>

<p>According to the indications furnished, iodine, bromine,
one, or all of the acids, the caustic alkalies, etc., are then detected
by means of the methods to be employed in cases where
the expert has a clew to the poison present. In this manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the presence of potassa and soda, and of bromine and iodine,
even in mixtures, is easily ascertained. It only remains to
mention the course to be pursued when suspicion exists that
poisoning has been caused by the administration of a mixture
of several acids. The suspected materials are boiled with water,
and alcohol added to the solution in order to coagulate the
animal matters. The solution is next filtered, the filtrate placed
in a retort provided with a receiver and distilled until the
residual portion acquires a pasty consistency. In this way, the
acids present are separated into two classes: (<i>a</i>) those that are
sufficiently volatile to have passed into the receiver, such as,
acetic, nitric, hydrochloric and sulphuric acids (the latter acid
will only be partially volatilized); and (<i>b</i>) those that remain in
the retort. The former are detected by examining the distillate
as previously directed.</p>

<p>The residue remaining in the retort is treated with absolute
alcohol, the fluid filtered, and a solution of acetate of lead
added to the filtrate: sulphuric, phosphoric and oxalic acids,
if present, are precipitated. The precipitate is suspended in
water and decomposed by means of sulphuretted hydrogen.
The acids contained are now set free, and are detected by applying
the tests already mentioned.</p>

<p>If there be reason to suspect the presence of both sulphuric
and oxalic acids, the distillation is discontinued after a short
time. The two acids are dissolved by shaking the moderately
concentrated fluid remaining in the retort with ether, and,
upon evaporating the solution, will be obtained in a state suitable
for examination. Oxalic acid is then detected by means
of sulphate of lime; sulphuric by means of oxalate of baryta.</p>

<p>The above examinations would fail to effect the detection
of <i>phosphorus</i>, and it is necessary to examine a separate portion
of the original substance for this body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS.</a></h2>


<h3>DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE AND COLOR OF
THE HAIR AND BEARD.</h3>

<p>A criminal, in order to conceal his identity, may change
the color of the hair and beard by artificial means; either to
a darker shade, in case they were naturally of a light color,
or, to a lighter hue, if they were originally dark, and the
chemical expert may be called upon to detect this artificial
coloration, and restore the original color of the hair.</p>

<p>It may also happen, that portions of hair still adhere to
the clots of blood sometimes found on an instrument which
has been employed in the commission of a crime, and consequently
the question may arise as to the nature of the hair,
whether it be human or animal.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE COLOR OF THE HAIR AND BEARD.</h4>

<p>The mode of examination necessary when the hair has
been blackened is different from that used when it has been
decolorized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<h5><i>The hair has been blackened.</i></h5>

<p>As various methods of dyeing hair black are in use, the
means of restoring the original color differ. The following
are the methods most usually employed in dyeing:</p>

<p>1º. The hair is well rubbed with a pomade, in which finely
pulverized charcoal is incorporated. This preparation, which
is sold under the name of "<i>mélaïnocome</i>," possesses the disadvantage
of soiling the fingers and clothing, even for several
days after its application.</p>

<p>2º. The hair is moistened with a dilute solution of ammonia,
and a perfectly neutral solution of a bismuth salt (chloride
or nitrate) is then applied. It is subsequently washed, and allowed
to remain in contact with a solution of sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p>3º. The same operation is performed, a lead compound
being substituted for the bismuth salt.</p>

<p>4º. A mixture of litharge, chalk, and slacked lime is applied,
and the head covered with a warm cloth. The hair is
afterwards washed, first with dilute vinegar, then with the
yolk of an egg.</p>

<p>5º. The hair is first cleansed with the yolk of an egg, and
then moistened with a solution of plumbate of lime; or,</p>

<p>6º. It is moistened with a solution of nitrate of silver, to
which a quantity of ammonia sufficient to dissolve the precipitate
first formed has been added.</p>

<p>The first method merely causes a mechanical admixture of
a coloring matter with the hair. In the four succeeding processes,
a black metallic sulphide is produced; either by the
subsequent application of a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen,
or by the action of the sulphur normally present in the
hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>In the last method, the formation of sulphide of silver
doubtless occurs; but the principal change that takes place
is probably due to the action of light, which, as is well known,
decomposes the salts of silver.</p>

<p>In order to restore the original color to hair which has
been treated with "<i>mélaïnocome</i>," it is only necessary to
dissolve in ether the fatty matters present, and then remove
the charcoal by washing with water.</p>

<p>In case the hair has been dyed by means of a bismuth or
lead salt (as in methods 2, 3, 4 and 5), it is immersed for
several hours in dilute hydrochloric acid: the metal present
dissolves, as chloride, and the original color of the hair is
rendered apparent. It then remains to detect the metal
dissolved in the acid solution, in order to establish, beyond
doubt, the fact that a dye has been employed. This is accomplished
by means of the methods used for the detection of
metals in cases of supposed poisoning.</p>

<p>If, finally, an ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver has
been employed to cause the coloration, the hair is immersed,
for some time, in a dilute solution of cyanide of potassium, and
the fluid subsequently examined for silver. In case a portion
of the salt has been converted into the sulphide, it will be
difficult to restore the original color, as the removal of this
compound is not easily effected.</p>


<h5><i>The hair has been decolorized.</i></h5>

<p>Black hair can be bleached by means of chlorine-water,
the various shades of the blonde being produced by the more
or less prolonged action of the reagent. In this case, the
odor of chlorine is completely removed only with great
difficulty, and the hair is rarely uniformly decolorized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The expert may therefore be able to observe indication
that will greatly assist him in arriving at a definite conclusion.
The hair should be carefully examined up to the
roots: if several days have elapsed since the decolorization
has been performed, the lower portion of the hair will have
grown and will exhibit its natural color. No method has yet
been proposed that restores the original color to bleached
hair. It is very possible, however, that this end would be
attained by allowing nascent hydrogen to act upon the decolorized
hair. For this purpose, it would be necessary to
immerse it in water containing some sodium amalgam, and
slightly acidulated with acetic acid.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE OF THE HAIR.</h4>

<p>In examinations of this character use is made of the
microscope. The hair to be examined is suspended in syrup,
oil, or glycerine and placed between two thin glass plates.
Human hair is sometimes cylindrical; sometimes flattened.
It consists either of a central canal, or of a longitudinal
series of oblong cavities which contain oily coloring matter,
and possesses the same diameter throughout its entire length.
The brown hair of the beard and whiskers, medium-sized
chestnut hair, the hair of a young blonde girl, and the
downy hair of a young man possess respectively a diameter
of 0.03 to 0.15; 0.08 to 0.09; 0.06; and 0.015 to 0.022
millimetres. These exhibit on the surface slightly projecting
scales, which are irregularly sinuous at the border, separated
from each other by a space of about 0.01 m.m., and are
transparent, whatever may be their color.</p>

<p>The hair of ruminants is short and stiff, and is characterized
by containing cavities filled with air. Wool, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
forms an exception, as it consists of entire hairs, homogeneous
in appearance and possessing imbricated scales, which bestow
upon it the property of being felted.</p>

<p>The hair of the horse, ox and cow never exceeds 12 m.m.
in length, and is tapering, its diameter gradually diminishing
from the base. It is perfectly opaque, and does not appear
to possess a central canal; has a reddish color, and frequently
exhibits lateral swellings, from which small filaments occasionally
become detached, in the same manner as a twig
separates itself from the parent branch.</p>


<h3>EXAMINATION OF FIRE-ARMS.<br/>

<span class="subtitle">(<i>Proposed by M. Boutigny.</i>)</span></h3>

<p>The examination of fire-arms is sometimes useful in determining
the date at which a weapon has been discharged or
reloaded. The methods used in examinations of this nature
vary, as the weapon under inspection is one provided with a
flint or an ordinary percussion lock. The value of the tests
employed is also affected by the kind of powder used; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
whether common gunpowder, gun-cotton or white gunpowder
(prepared by mixing yellow prussiate of potassa, chlorate of
potassa and sugar) has been taken.</p>


<h4>THE GUN IS PROVIDED WITH A FLINT-LOCK, AND WAS CHARGED
WITH ORDINARY POWDER.</h4>

<p>In case the weapon has been wiped or exposed to moisture
subsequent to its seizure, it is impossible to form any
conclusion as to the date of its discharge, etc. It is therefore
advisable, upon receiving the weapon, to carefully wrap the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
lock in a woollen cloth, and to close the barrel. The exterior
of the gun is at first submitted to a careful examination, and
notice taken of the approximate thickness of any existing rust
spots. The fire-pan and adjacent portion of the barrel are
also examined by aid of a magnifying glass, especial attention
being given to the detection of traces of a moist and pulverulent
incrustation of a greyish or blackish color, formed by the
combustion of the gunpowder, and of crystals of sulphate of
iron. If the weapon is loaded, the wad is withdrawn and the
color of its cylindrical portion and of the powder, as well as
the size of the ball or shot, noted.</p>

<p>This preliminary examination ended, the barrel and fire-pan
are separately washed with distilled water, and the washings
passed through filter paper which has previously been
well washed, first with pure hydrochloric acid, then with distilled
water. The filtrate is next divided into three portions,
and these separately examined for: (1) sulphuric acid, by
addition of chloride of barium; (2) for iron, by oxidizing the
salts contained in the fluid with a few drops of nitric acid and
adding a solution of ferrocyanide of potassium, the presence
of iron being indicated by the formation of a blue coloration,
or a blue precipitate; and (3) for sulphides, by means of a
solution of subacetate of lead.</p>

<p>If a bluish-black incrustation is discovered on the fire-pan
or on the neighboring portions of the barrel, and both rust and
crystals of sulphate of iron are absent, and the washings, which
were originally of a light-yellow color, assume a chocolate-brown
coloration upon the addition of solution of subacetate
of lead, <i>the gun has been discharged within two hours at
the longest</i>.</p>

<p>If the incrustation possesses a lighter color and traces of
iron have been detected in the washings, but neither rust nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
crystals have been discovered on the barrel or fire-pan, <i>the weapon
has been discharged more than two, but less than twenty-four
hours</i>.</p>

<p>In case minute crystals of sulphate of iron and spots of
rust are found, and the washings contain iron in a considerable
quantity, <i>the weapon has been discharged at least twenty-four
hours, at the longest ten days</i>.</p>

<p>If the quantity of rust found is considerable, but iron is no
longer to be detected, <i>the discharge of the gun occurred ten days,
at the longest fifty days, previously</i>.</p>

<p><i>If the weapon has been reloaded immediately after its discharge
without having been previously washed</i>, the portions of the wadding
which have come in contact with the barrel will possess a
greyish-black color during the first four days, the color gradually
becoming lighter, until, at the fifteenth day, it turns grey
and remains so permanently. In this case, the washings will
contain sulphuric acid. The objection has been advanced to
the last test that sulphuric acid might be discovered, even
if the gun had not been discharged, if the paper of which
the wadding was made contained plaster. M. Boutigny states,
however, that this objection is untenable, if the wadding
has not been moistened by the water introduced into the
barrel.</p>

<p><i>In case the gun has been washed and dried before being reloaded</i>,
the cylindrical portion of the wadding possesses an ochre-yellow
color up to the first or second day, assumes a decided
red hue on the days following, and acquires a clear rusty
color on the sixth day. During the fifth day the powder also
possesses a reddish appearance, owing to an admixture of rust.
Sulphuric acid is not present in the washings.</p>

<p><i>If the weapon has been reloaded immediately after being washed</i>,
the wadding possesses a greenish-yellow appearance for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
few hours, and subsequently acquires a reddish color, as in the
preceding case.</p>

<p><i>If, finally, the barrel has been washed with turbid lime-water</i>,
rust is still to be found and the wadding possesses the color
mentioned above. The following colorations are also to be
observed in case the gun has not been washed, or has been
dried near a fire:</p>

<h4>THE GUN IS NOT PROVIDED WITH A FLINT LOCK.</h4>

<p>At present weapons having flint-locks have almost entirely gone
out of use and have been superseded by the ordinary percussion
gun; these latter, in turn, are being gradually replaced by
breech-loaders, charged with or without a metallic cartridge. The
indications obtained in the preceding examinations by means of
the fire-pan, will therefore disappear; the results given by the
inspection of the barrel may possibly hold good. In regard
to breech-loaders, all the useful indications furnished by the
coloration of the wadding and powder fail to occur; the latter
being enclosed either in a paper cylinder or in a copper socket.</p>

<p>The fact that gun cotton and white gunpowder are occasionally
made use of, adds to the difficulty of obtaining reliable
results by the mere inspection of a weapon. White gunpowder
does not oxidize the gun, fails to give rise to any salt of iron,
and possesses a white color; gun-cotton produces distinctive
indications varying with its purity. Owing to these facts, it is
evident that the method proposed by M. Boutigny is of no real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
value, save in the rare instances where a gun provided with a
fire-pan, and charged with ordinary powder, is under examination,
and the question of the lapse of time since the discharge
of a weapon must remain undetermined so far as scientific
tests are concerned.</p>


<h3>DETECTION OF HUMAN REMAINS IN THE ASHES OF A
FIRE-PLACE.</h3>

<p>This class of examinations is particularly necessary when
the crime of infanticide is suspected. As the complete incineration
of a cadaver is a long and difficult operation, it frequently
occurs that bones&mdash;partially or completely carbonized,
but retaining their original form&mdash;are discovered by the careful
examination of the ashes of the fire-place in which the combustion
was accomplished.</p>

<p>When this is not the case and complete incineration and
disaggregation have occurred, recourse must be had to the indications
furnished by a chemical analysis. These indications
are reliable, however, only when the certainty exists that bones
of animals have not been consumed in the same fire-place;
otherwise, the results obtained are entirely worthless, the reactions
given by ashes of animal bones being identical with those
produced by the ashes of a human body. Two tests are employed
to detect the presence of bones in the residue left by
the combustion of animal matter.</p>

<p>1. A portion of the ashes is placed in a silver crucible,
heated with potassa, and the mass afterwards treated with cold
water. If animal matter is contained in the consumed materials,
cyanide of potassium will be present in the aqueous
solution. In order to detect this salt, the fluid is acidulated
with hydrochloric acid, and a solution of persulphate
of iron added: the formation of a blue precipitate indicates
the presence of the cyanide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The ashes are next examined for phosphate of lime. As
wood, coal, and the other substances usually employed for
heating purposes contain none or little of this salt, its detection
in a notable quantity would lead to the inference that bones
have been consumed. The ashes are allowed to digest for
twenty-four hours with one-quarter of their weight of sulphuric
acid. Water is next added to the pasty mixture, and the fluid
filtered. If phosphate of lime be present, it is converted by
this treatment into a soluble acid phosphate, which passes into
the filtrate. Upon adding ammonia to the filtrate, a precipitate
of neutral phosphate of lime is formed, neutral phosphate
of ammonia remaining in solution. The fluid is again filtered,
the filtrate acidulated with nitric acid, and then boiled with a
solution of molybdate of ammonia likewise acidulated with nitric
acid: in presence of a phosphate, a yellow precipitate, or at least
a yellow coloration of the fluid, will be produced. It has been
stated that the disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen, upon
treating the ashes with sulphuric acid, is an indication that
the combustion of a human body has occurred; this reaction
is, however, valueless, inasmuch as coal and certain vegetable
ashes likewise evolve the gas when subjected to the same
treatment.</p>


<h3>EXAMINATION OF WRITINGS.</h3>

<p>Contracts, checks, etc., are frequently altered with criminal
intent, either by erasing the portion of the writing over the
signature and substituting other matter, or by changing certain
words, in order to modify the signification of a sentence.</p>

<p>Writings are altered either by erasure or by washing.
Erasure, although more easily executed, is seldom employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as it renders the paper thin in places, and in this way leaves
effects apparent even to the naked eye, and, although the
original thickness can be restored by application of sandarac
or alum, these substances possess properties differing from
those exhibited by paper, and may, moreover, be completely
removed, thus exposing the thinning of the paper.</p>

<p>In case washing by means of chlorine has been resorted
to, the sizing&mdash;which renders the paper non-bibulous, and which
is only with difficulty replaced&mdash;may have been removed.
Formerly paper was sized by immersion in a solution of gelatine;
at present, however, a soap of resin, or wax, and
alumina (a little starch being added) is more commonly used.
In the latter case, the sizing is less easily removed by the
action of water than when the gelatine preparation is employed;
the detection of its attempted restoration is also a matter
of less difficulty, as gelatine would be employed for this purpose,
and this body possesses properties different from those
exhibited by the substances normally contained in paper:
iodine, for instance, which imparts a yellow color to gelatine,
turns starch violet-blue. In order to detect the alteration of
a writing, the following examinations are made:</p>

<p>1º. The paper is carefully examined in all of its parts, and
in various positions, by aid of a lens. In this way, either
thinned points, caused by erasure, or remaining traces of
words, may possibly be discovered.</p>

<p>2º. The paper is next placed upon a perfectly clean piece
of glass, and completely and uniformly moistened with water.
The glass is then removed, and the transparency of the paper
examined by aid of a lens. When uniform transparency is
exhibited, and certain portions are neither more transparent
nor more opaque than the rest of the paper, it is probable that
erasure has not been attempted. If, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
opaque points are observed, it is almost certain that letters
have been erased, and sandarac, which is not affected by
water, subsequently applied. In case transparent points are
detected, there is reason to suspect that words have been
removed, and the spots either left intact or afterwards coated
with a substance soluble in water, such as alum.</p>

<p>3º. The paper is dried and the above operation repeated
with alcohol of 87 per cent. Indications may now be observed
which failed to occur in the treatment with water; as well as
these latter confirmed. As alcohol dissolves sandarac, the
points that formerly appeared opaque may now become transparent.</p>

<p>4º. The paper is again dried, then placed under a sheet of
very thin silk-paper, and a warm iron passed over it. This
operation frequently causes the reappearance of words that
have been partially obliterated. It is also advisable&mdash;as suggested
by <i>M. Lassaigne</i>&mdash;to expose the paper to the action of
iodine vapors. If alteration has not been attempted, the paper
will acquire an uniform color; yellow, if sized with gelatine;
violet blue, if sized with the mixture of soap, resin and starch.
When, on the contrary, a subsequent sizing of gelatine has been
applied in order to mask the alteration&mdash;the paper having been
originally sized with the above mixture&mdash;it will assume in some
portions a yellow, in others a violet-blue color.</p>

<p>5º. It is ascertained whether the paper possesses an acid reaction.
If so, its acidity may result from the presence of hydrochloric
acid, in case the paper was washed with chlorine, or of
other acids. Alum, used to disguise erasure, would also cause
an acid reaction. The mere detection of acidity is, in itself, of
little importance, as, in the manufacture of paper, the pulp is
bleached by means of chlorine, and this reagent may not have
been entirely removed by washing. If, however, the paper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
acid only in certain spots, and these points produce a red
coloration upon blue litmus paper, having the form of letters,
the indication is of value. In order to ascertain if this be the
case, it is advisable, before wetting the paper, to slightly press
it upon a sheet of moist litmus paper: the acid spots will then
leave a reddish trace upon the latter.</p>

<p>6º. The manuscript under examination is again spread
upon a glass-plate, and a solution of tannin (or preferably, a
solution of ferrocyanide of potassium containing one per
cent. of the salt, and acidulated with acetic acid) applied by
means of a brush. If the original writing was executed with
ordinary ink (which has as its base tannate of iron), and the
washing has been but imperfectly performed, it is quite possible
that a blue coloration will be produced by the action of the
ferrocyanide. It is, however, often necessary to apply the
above reagents several times before the original writing
becomes apparent; indeed, in some cases months have elapsed
before the reaction has occurred.</p>

<p>In case the alteration or destruction of the document is
feared in the above test, it is well to previously provide the
court with a certified copy, and then proceed with the examination.</p>

<p>7º. If the paper possesses a friable appearance, it has possibly
been washed with sulphuric acid. This property may
however originate from other causes, and the presence of the
acid should be confirmed by washing the document with distilled
water, and adding a solution of chloride of barium to
the washings. The precipitate should form in a considerable
quantity, as a slight cloudiness could be due to sulphates
contained in the water used in the preparation of the pulp.</p>

<p>If much sulphuric acid be present, it may be so concentrated
by heating as to cause the carbonization of the paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>8º. It is also well, should washing with sulphuric acid be
suspected, to ascertain, by aid of a lens, if the filaments on
the surface of the manuscript possess an inflated appearance.
This would be caused by the escape of carbonic acid,
originating from the action of sulphuric acid upon the carbonates
contained in the water used in the manufacture of
the paper.</p>

<p>9º. Old ink is more difficult to remove than new, and it is
therefore sometimes possible to cause the reappearance of
old writings, over which words have been subsequently written.
For this purpose, a solution containing 50 per cent. of
oxalic acid is applied with a fine brush over the suspected
points. As soon as the ink disappears, the acid is immediately
removed by washing with water, and the paper dried.
Upon now repeating the operation, the presence of a former
writing may be detected after the complete disappearance of
the words last written.</p>

<p>10º. According to <i>M. Lassaigne</i>, when the same ink has
not been used throughout a document, washing with dilute
hydrochloric acid will demonstrate the fact. This acid, while
causing the gradual obliteration of characters written with
ordinary ink&mdash;the shade of the paper not being altered&mdash;produces
a red color, if ink containing log-wood has been
employed, and a green coloration, in case the ink used
contained Prussian blue.</p>

<p>The expert may possibly be called upon to give evidence
as to the existence of a "<i>trompe-l'oeil</i>;" as was the case in
the trial of <i>M. de Preigne</i>, which took place at Montpelier in
1852. A "<i>trompe-l'oeil</i>" consists of two sheets of paper,
glued together at the edges, but having the upper sheet shorter
than the other which therefore extends below it. This species
of fraud is executed by writing unimportant matter on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
uppermost sheet, and then obtaining the desired signature,
care being taken that it is written on the portion of the paper
projecting below. The signature having been procured, it is
only necessary to detach the two sheets in order to obtain a
blank paper containing the signature, over which whatever is
desired can be inserted. The trial referred to above, was in
reference to a receipt for 3,000 francs. The expert,
upon placing pieces of moistened paper upon the suspected
document, noticed that they adhered to certain
points, and that these formed a border around the paper but
passing <i>above</i> the signature. The fraudulency of the act was
thus established, and so recognized by the court, although the
accused was acquitted by the jury.</p>

<p>Numerous means have been proposed, in order to render
the falsification of documents a matter of difficulty. The
most reliable of these is the use of "Grimpe's safety-paper,"
containing microscopic figures, the reproduction of which is
impossible. Unfortunately, up to the present, the government
has adopted methods less sure.</p>


<h3>EXAMINATION OF WRITINGS IN CASES WHERE A SYMPATHETIC
INK HAS BEEN USED.</h3>

<p>Sympathetic inks are those which, although invisible at the
time of writing, become apparent by the application of certain
agents. They are of two classes: those which are rendered
visible by the mere application of heat, such as chloride of
cobalt, or the juice of onions; and those which are brought
out only by the action of a reagent. The inks of the second
class most frequently used are solutions of acetates of lead,
and other metals which give a colored sulphide when treated
with sulphuretted hydrogen. Characters written with a solution
of ferrocyanide of potassium acquire a blue color, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
washed with a solution of perchloride of iron. It is scarcely
necessary to add that the latter solution can be used as the
ink, and the ferrocyanide as the developer.</p>

<p>When the presence of characters written with a sympathetic
ink is suspected, the document is examined as follows:</p>

<p>1. The paper is at first warmed: if the ink used is of the
first class, the characters will now become legible; otherwise
the examination is continued as below.</p>

<p>2. The paper is exposed to the action of steam, in order to
moisten the ink present (care being taken to avoid dissolving
the characters), and a current of sulphuretted hydrogen allowed
to act upon it. If the ink used consists of a lead, bismuth,
or gold salt, a black coloration will ensue; if salts of cadmium
or arsenic were employed, the characters will acquire a yellow
color; if, finally, a salt of antimony was used, a red coloration
will be produced.</p>

<p>3. If no coloration was caused by the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen, it is probably that either a solution of ferrocyanide
of potassium or a persalt of iron has been resorted to.
Each of these solutions is separately applied on a small portion
of paper by means of a brush, and notice taken if the
characters become visible. The solution that produced the
change is then applied over the entire sheet.</p>

<p>4. In case only negative results were obtained in the preceding
operations, it must not yet be concluded that a sympathetic
ink has not been used, although we are left without
further recourse to chemical tests. Numerous organic compounds
may have been resorted to, the detection of which is
almost impossible; moreover, if a mistake was made in regard
to the preparation supposed to have been used, the reagents
employed for its detection may render the discovery of another
ink absolutely impossible. It is therefore often neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>sary
to apply mechanical tests. For this purpose, the paper
is spread upon a glass plate, uniformly moistened with water,
and a second plate placed over it: if the characters were written
with a pulverulent substance suspended in water or mucilage,
they may often be observed upon examining the transparency
of the paper. In case the substance used is both colorless
and soluble, the detection of the written characters will be
more difficult; still, indelible traces may possibly have been
left by the pen. If, however, the ink employed is a colorless
and transparent organic compound of rare occurrence, and was
applied with a fine pencil-brush which failed to affect the
paper, it must be acknowledged that little or nothing can be
definitely determined as to its presence or absence.</p>


<h3>FALSIFICATION OF COINS AND ALLOYS.</h3>

<p>In all civilized countries a fixed standard for coins and
precious alloys is established by law, in order to prevent the
perpetration of frauds which would be of serious injury to the
public welfare. The substitution of coins consisting of an
alloy inferior in value to the standard fixed by law, is too
advantageous a fraud not to be often attempted.</p>

<p>Coins are most frequently altered by <i>clipping</i>; by <i>stuffing</i>,
that is, by boring the coin and inserting an alloy of small value;
by <i>doubling</i>, which operation consists in covering its face with
two thin laminæ taken from a genuine coin; and by applying
a coating of gold or silver by means of electro-plating.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain if a coin has been counterfeited, its
weight should at first be determined. If it has been clipped,
or consists of an alloy possessing a density less than that of
silver or gold, the fact is immediately demonstrated by its
decreased gravity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The coin is further tested by throwing it down upon a hard
substance: gold and silver give a ringing sound, whereas the
majority of other metals produce a dull sound.</p>

<p>The result obtained by this latter test often fails to be
reliable. A skilful counterfeiter may prepare an alloy equally
sonorous and heavy as silver or gold; in fact, <i>M. Duloz</i> exhibited
to the author an alloy, prepared by him, possessing
the density, sonorousness and lustre of silver; the composition
of which, for obvious reasons, has not been published.</p>

<p>In instances of this nature the fusibility of the coin should
be determined, and the result obtained compared with the
melting point of the legal alloy, or, this failing, a chemical
analysis executed. In order to perform the latter test, the
coin under examination is boiled with nitric acid: all metals
are dissolved, with exception of gold and platinum, which
remain unaltered, and tin and antimony, which are converted
respectively into metastannic and antimonic acids. The fluid
is filtered, the insoluble residue well washed, and then boiled
with hydrochloric acid, which dissolves the metastannic and
antimonic acids. The solution is again filtered, and the second
residue dissolved in <i>aqua regia</i>. The metals dissolved in the
several filtrates are then detected, either by the processes
previously given for the detection of metallic poisons, or by
the more complete methods contained in works on chemical
analysis. This qualitative test is, however, insufficient, in case
the falsification consisted in merely diminishing the proportions
of the valuable metals contained in the alloy, without changing
its qualitative composition: it is then necessary to execute a
quantitative estimation of the metals present. As this operation
requires considerable practice and the methods employed
are to be found in all treatises on quantitative analysis, we will
not reproduce them here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>


<h3>EXAMINATION OF ALIMENTARY AND PHARMACEUTICAL
SUBSTANCES.</h3>

<p>We will next enumerate the methods employed in the
detection of the principal adulterations to which flour, bread,
oils of seeds, milk, wines, vinegar and the sulphate of quinine
are subjected. These researches, united with those preceding,
fail to embrace all the diverse examinations which the
chemical expert may be expected to execute; but we do not
claim to foresee all the contingencies that may arise, and
will describe the steps to be pursued in instances which are
anticipated, at the same time indicating general methods
applicable to cases not here included.</p>


<h4>FLOUR AND BREAD.</h4>

<p>The adulterations to which flour and bread are exposed
usually consist in adding damaged or an inferior grade of
flour to wheaten flour, or in disguising the presence of a
poor quality of flour by the addition of mineral substances,
such as: plaster, chalk, lime, alum, and sulphate of copper.</p>

<p>Good flour has a white color, possessing a slightly yellow
tinge, but is entirely free from red, grey or black specks. It
is soft to the touch and adheres to the fingers, acquiring, when
compressed in the hand, a soft cushion-like form. If mixed
with water, it forms an elastic, homogeneous, but slightly coherent
dough, which can be extended out in thin layers.</p>

<p>Flour of an inferior quality possess a dull white color, and
does not assume the cushion-like condition mentioned above,
when pressed in the hand, but escapes between the fingers:
the dough formed is of a poorer quality.</p>

<p>Flour which has been damaged by moisture has a dull or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
reddish-white hue, and possesses a mouldy, or even a noxious,
odor, as well as a bitter and nauseous taste which produces
a marked acid sensation in the throat. Occasionally the
presence of moisture causes the growth of <i>fungi</i>, the introduction
of which in the digestive organs would cause serious
results.</p>

<p>The constituents of pure flour are:</p>

<ul class="app">
<li><i>Gluten.</i></li>
<li><i>Starch</i>, in the proportion of 50 to 75 per cent.</li>
<li><i>Dextrine</i>, in the proportion of several per cent.</li>
<li><i>Glucose</i>, in the proportion of several per cent.</li>
<li><i>Salts</i>, remaining in the ash obtained by the calcination of
the flour, in a proportion not exceeding 2 per cent.</li>
<li><i>Water</i>, of which it loses 12 to 15 per cent., at the heat
of a water-bath, and 15 to 20 per cent., at a temperature of
160°.</li>
<li><i>Bran</i>, (ligneous and fatty matter,) in a very small
proportion,
when the flour has been properly bolted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the process of bread-making, the gluten undergoes
fermentation by the action of the leaven and liberates carbonic
acid, which causes the dough to become porous and swell up,
or, as it is termed, to <i>rise</i>. Bread contains the same substances
as flour, but gluten and starch are present in a state that
does not admit of their separation by mechanical means, and
glucose, if present at all, exists in a smaller quantity: the
proportion of dextrine and water is, on the other hand, considerably
increased. The bread of the Paris city bakeries
contains 40 per cent. of water&mdash;the crumb, which forms <sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> of
the weight of the bread, containing 45 per cent.; the crust,
which constitutes the remaining <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>, containing 15 per cent.
In army bread 43 per cent. of water are contained&mdash;the
crumb, which constitutes <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> of the weight of the bread, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
50 per cent.; the crust which forms the remaining <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, containing
15 per cent.</p>

<p>The addition of common salt naturally increases the proportion
of ash left upon calcining bread.</p>

<p>Water is contained in stale bread in the same quantity as
in fresh bread; but exists in a modified molecular condition:
upon heating stale bread, it acquires the properties of fresh
bread.</p>

<p>The following substances are used in the adulteration of
wheaten <span class="locked">flour:<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16" href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></span></p>

<ul class="app">
<li>Potato-starch.</li>
<li>Meals of various grains (rice, barley, corn, oats and rye).</li>
<li>Vegetable meals, (beans, horse-beans, kidney-beans, peas, vetch, lentils, etc.).</li>
<li>Darnel meal.</li>
<li>Buckwheat flour.</li>
<li>Linseed-meal.</li>
<li>Mineral substances (plaster, chalk, lime, alum, and sulphate of copper).</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to detect these substances, the gluten, the starch,
and the ash are separately examined.</p>


<h5><i>a.</i> EXAMINATION OF THE GLUTEN.</h5>

<p>In order to separate the gluten, two parts of the flour to
be examined and one part of water are mixed into a paste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and this is placed in a fine linen sack, in which it is kneaded under
a stream of water so long as the washings have a turbid appearance:
these are preserved. The gluten obtained from good
wheaten flour possesses a light-yellow color; emits a stale
odor; and spreads out, when placed in a saucer. In case the
flour has been too strongly heated in the grinding, or otherwise
badly prepared, the gluten is granulous, difficult to collect
in the hand, and somewhat resembles flint-stone in appearance.</p>

<p>Gluten prepared from a mixture of equal parts of wheat
and <i>rye</i> is adhesive, blackish, without homogeneousness,
spreads out more readily than pure wheaten gluten, separates
easily and adheres somewhat to the fingers.</p>

<p>Gluten obtained from a mixture of wheat and <i>barley</i> is
non-adhesive, of a dirty reddish-brown color, and appears to
be formed of intertwined vermicular filaments.</p>

<p>Gluten formed from a mixture of equal parts of wheat and
<i>oats</i> has a blackish-yellow color and exhibits, at the surface,
numerous small white specks.</p>

<p>The gluten from a mixture of wheat and <i>corn</i> has a yellowish
color, is non-adhesive, but firm, and does not readily
spread.</p>

<p>Gluten prepared from a mixture of wheat and <i>leguminous
flour</i> is neither cohesive nor elastic, and, if the proportion of
the latter present be considerable, can be separated and
passed through a sieve, like starch.</p>

<p>The gluten obtained from a mixture of equal parts of
wheat and <i>buckwheat</i> flour is very homogeneous, and is as
easily prepared as the gluten from pure wheaten flour. It
possesses when moist a dark-grey color; which changes to a
deep black upon drying. The proportion of gluten in flour is
exceedingly variable: good flour contains from 10 to 11 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
cent. of dry gluten; poor flour from 8 to 9 per cent. of moist
gluten, equal to about one-third of its weight of the dry compound.</p>


<h5><i>b.</i> EXAMINATION OF THE STARCH.</h5>

<p>The washings of the flour are allowed to stand for some
time in a conical-shaped vessel. As soon as the amylaceous
matter has entirely settled to the bottom of the vessel, the
greater portion of the water is decanted, and the residual mass
brought upon a small filter and allowed to dry. The residue
is then examined for potato and rice starch.</p>

<p><i>Potato starch.</i> The grains of potato starch are much
larger than those of wheaten starch. If a portion of the
residue mentioned above is crushed in an agate mortar, the
granules of potato starch present are ruptured, and their
contents liberated; the wheaten starch remaining unaltered.
The mass is then taken up with water, and the fluid filtered.
If potato starch be present, the filtrate will acquire a blue
color upon addition of an aqueous solution of iodine; otherwise,
a yellow or violet-rose coloration is produced. It is
necessary to avoid crushing the residue for too long a time, as
the granules of wheaten starch would also become ruptured by
prolonged comminution.</p>

<p>Besides the difference presented by potato starch in the
size of the granules in comparison to those of wheaten starch,
the former swell to ten or fifteen times the volume of the
latter, when treated with a solution of potassa: wheaten
starch granules are not affected by the treatment, if the solution
used does not contain more than 2 per cent. of the salt.
The results obtained by the above operation should be confirmed
by a microscopic examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/fig13t.jpg" alt="Fig. 13." title="Fig. 13." />
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 13.
 </div>
</div>
<p>A portion of the residue is moistened with solution of
iodine, then carefully dried, and placed on the slide of a
microscope. The mass is next moistened with a solution
containing 2 per cent. of potassa, and examined. The addition
of iodine causes the potato starch granules to acquire a
blue color, and renders their shape and volume more easily
perceptible; thus allowing the two varieties of starch to be
readily distinguished. Fig. 13 represents the relative size of
the granules as observed under the <span class="locked">microscope.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17" href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence of potato starch in bread is also detected by
crushing a small portion of the sample under examination on
the glass, and then adding a few drops of the alkaline solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/fig14t.jpg" alt="Fig. 14." title="Fig. 14." />
 <div class="caption">
   Fig. 14.
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<i>Rice and Corn.</i>&mdash;If rice or corn meal have been mixed with
the flour, angular and translucent fragments (Fig. 14) are observed
in the microscopic examination. Corn meal acquires a
yellow color, if treated with dilute potassa solution.</p>



<h5>MISCELLANEOUS TESTS.</h5>

<p><i>Linseed and rye meals.</i>&mdash;If linseed meal is moistened with
an aqueous solution containing 14 per cent. of potassa and examined
under the microscope, numerous minute characteristic
granules, smaller than the grains of potato-starch, are observed.
These possess a vitreous appearance, sometimes a reddish
color, and usually form in squares or very regular rectangles.
The test is equally applicable to bread. The detection of linseed
and rye meals is simultaneously effected by exhausting the
suspected flour with ether, then filtering the solution and allowing
it to evaporate. If the flour contains rye, the oil left by
the evaporation, when heated with a solution of mercury
in concentrated nitric acid, is converted into a solid substance
having a fine red color; but it remains unaltered,
if entirely due to linseed. In case the oil becomes solidified,
the mercury salt present should be removed by washing
with water, the residue taken up with boiling alcohol of
36° B. and the solution filtered: upon evaporating the alcoholic
filtrate, a residue is obtained consisting of the linseed
oil present.</p>

<p><i>Buckwheat.</i>&mdash;Flour adulterated with buckwheat is less soft
to the touch, does not pack as easily, and passes more readily
through a sieve than pure wheaten flour. It presents, here
and there, blackish particles, due to the perisperm of the grain,
and has a dirty-white color. As previously remarked, the gluten
obtained from a mixture of buckwheat and wheaten flour
possesses a grey or even a black color. The starch furnished
by buckwheat flour exhibits polyhedral agglomerations, analogous
to those presented by corn.</p>

<p><i>Darnel.</i>&mdash;The use of darnel in the adulteration of wheaten
flour may give rise to serious sanitary results. To effect its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
detection, the flour to be examined is digested with alcohol of
35° B.: if the flour be pure, the alcohol remains limpid: it acquires
a straw-yellow tint, due to traces of bran present, but&mdash;although
a peculiar resin may be dissolved&mdash;the solution does
not possess a disagreeable taste. When, on the contrary, darnel
is present, the alcohol assumes a green tint, which gradually
deepens, and possesses a bitter and nauseous taste; the residue,
left by the evaporation of the tincture to dryness, has a
greenish-yellow color, and a still more disagreeable flavor than
the alcoholic solution.</p>

<p><i>Legumens.</i>&mdash;Leguminous meals cannot be added otherwise
than in small proportions to wheaten flour, owing to the rapidity
with which they change the properties of the latter, and
communicate to it their characteristic odor&mdash;noticeable upon
treating the flour with a little boiling water. Their presence
is also easily detected by the distinctive properties of the vegetable
itself, and by the appearance of the amylaceous residue
in the microscopic examination. In order to decide as to the
presence of legumens, the washings containing the starchy matter
of the flour, after the particles of gluten present have been
separated by passing the fluid through a silk sieve, are divided
into two portions. One portion is allowed to undergo fermentation,
at a temperature of 18° to 20°: in case leguminous substances
are not present, lactic fermentation occurs and the
odor of sour milk is alone perceptible; if, on the other hand,
legumens are contained in the fluid, rancid fermentation takes
place, and an odor is emitted resembling that of decayed
cheese. The remaining portion of the washings, after being
decanted from the residue of amylaceous matter, is filtered
and evaporated until a yellowish translucent pellicle appears
upon its surface. The fluid is then again filtered from the
coagulated albumen common to all flours, and the legumin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>ous
substances present coagulated by the addition, drop by
drop, of acetic acid.</p>

<p>The leguminous deposit produced appears white and flaky;
when examined under the microscope, it presents lamilla emarginated
at the border; it is odorless and tasteless; when dried,
it assumes a horny appearance; it is insoluble, both in water
and alcohol, and does not become gelatinous when treated
with boiling water; it is readily soluble in potassa and other
alkaline solutions, from which it is precipitated upon addition
of nitric, hydrochloric, acetic, oxalic, and citric acids;
upon protracted boiling in water, it loses its property of being
soluble in ammonia. The above tests having been applied,
the residue containing the starch is next examined. For this
purpose, a small portion is moistened with a little water, a few
drops of iodine solution added, and the mixture placed on the
side of the microscope: the bluish grains contained in the
polyhedral and cellular envelope (Fig. 15)
are easily recognized. The mixture
on the glass may also be treated with an
aqueous solution of potassa (containing
10 per cent. of the salt), or with dilute hydrochloric
acid: these reagents dissolve
the starch present, leaving the reticulated
tissue intact. Should this examination
fail to give a definite result, the remaining portion of the
amylaceous residue is subjected to a sort of levigation, and
the part most slowly deposited separated. In this portion
the reticulated tissues of the leguminous substances present
are contained, and, as they are comparatively free from foreign
matters, their identification is a matter of comparative ease.
In case the presence of reticulated tissue is indicated, it is
still necessary to apply confirmatory chemical tests.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/fig15t.jpg" alt="Fig. 15." title="Fig. 15." />

 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Meals prepared from beans, horse-beans, and lentils, contain
a tannin which imparts a green or black color to salts of
iron. The coloration is rendered very sensitive if a rather considerable
quantity of the flour to be examined is passed through
a silk sieve, and the remaining bran treated with a solution of
sulphate of iron (<i>ferrico-ferrous</i> sulphate): the reaction immediately
occurs, even if the sample contains but 10 per cent. of
bean meal. The meals of horse-beans and of vetches acquire
a red color, when exposed to the successive action of nitric acid
and of ammonia vapors. In order to apply this test, the suspected
flour is placed upon the edge of a capsule containing
nitric acid, the latter heated, and, as a yellow coloration appears,
the acid removed and replaced by ammonia. The capsule
is then set aside: if the flour is adulterated with either of
the above vegetables, reddish spots, which are easily perceptible
by aid of a magnifying glass, are soon produced.</p>

<p>In case bread is to be examined, it is exhausted with water,
the fluid passed through a sieve, the upper layer decanted,
then evaporated, and the residue taken up with alcohol. The
tincture so obtained is evaporated, and the second residuum
treated with nitric acid and ammonia, as directed above.
When meals prepared from beans, vetches, or lentils are heated
on a water-bath with hydrochloric acid, diluted with three to
four times its volume of water, a cellular tissue, possessing the
color of wine-dregs, remains behind; flours of wheat, peas, and
kidney-beans leave a colorless residue, when subjected to the
same treatment.</p>

<p>Finally; the grains of the starch (<i>fecula</i>) of legumens possess
a volume about equal to that of potato granules, and
exhibit either a longitudinal furrow in the direction of their
longer axis, or a double furrow arranged in a star-like form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h5><i>c.</i> EXAMINATION OF THE ASH.</h5>

<p>Leguminous substances, and more particularly mineral
salts, are detected by the examination of the ash left upon
the incineration of the flour.</p>

<p><i>Detection of Legumens.</i>&mdash;Pure wheaten flour furnishes an
ash consisting of about 2 per cent. of its weight; whereas meals
of legumens leave from 3 to 4 per cent. of their weight in ash.
This difference is, however, too slight to furnish conclusive
results; the analysis of the ash is also necessary. The ash
of wheaten flour is non-deliquescent, dry, semi-fused, and chiefly
consists of phosphates of potassa, soda, magnesia and lime,
of sulphates, and of silica. The solution obtained by treating the
ash with water has an alkaline reaction. The phosphates of
the alkalies, present in the ash of wheat, exist in the state
of pyrophosphates, and, as chlorides are absent, the addition of
nitrate of silver to the aqueous solution of the ash produces
a white precipitate, consisting entirely of pyrophosphate of
silver, which is not affected by exposure to the light.</p>

<p>The ash of leguminous meals is deliquescent and soluble
in water, forming a <i>strongly</i> alkaline solution, which contains
both chlorides and <i>neutral</i> phosphates. The latter
give a clear yellow precipitate with nitrate of silver. Upon
adding a solution of this salt to the aqueous solution of the
ash, a <i>pale</i> yellow precipitate, which turns violet if exposed
to the light, is therefore produced.</p>

<p><i>Detection of mineral substances.</i>&mdash;The principal mineral substances,
that are fraudulently added to flour, are ground calcined
bones, sand, lime, plaster, alum, and sulphate of copper.
The two last named salts are almost invariably added in small
quantities; alum renders the flour white, even when used in
the proportion of one per cent.; sulphate of copper is added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to impart a good appearance to bread made from a damaged
flour.</p>

<p><i>a. Ground bones</i> (carbonate and phosphate of lime).&mdash;The
washings of the gluten are placed in a conical vessel, and, after
some time has elapsed, the clear supernatant fluid is removed
by means of a syphon, a conical shaped deposit remaining on
the bottom of the vessel: two hours later, the fresh layer of
fluid that has formed is removed with a pipette. As soon as
the residue becomes nearly solid, it is detached from the vessel,
placed upon a fragment of plaster, and allowed to dry.
The bones, being heavier than the amylaceous substances, are
to be found in the apex of the cone formed by the residue.
This is detached, and incinerated: in case the ash obtained
contains phosphate and carbonate of lime, the addition of
hydrochloric acid will cause effervescence, and, upon adding
ammonia to the acid solution, a white precipitate will be formed.
If the solution is then filtered and oxalate of ammonia
added to the filtrate, a precipitate will be produced which,
when heated to redness, leaves a residue of caustic lime possessing
an alkaline reaction.</p>

<p><i>b. Sand.</i>&mdash;As this substance possesses a much greater specific
gravity than the usual constituents of flour, it is only necessary,
in order to accomplish its separation, to repeatedly stir the
flour with water, and remove the deposit at first formed, which,
if consisting of sand, will be insoluble in acids, and will grate,
when placed between the teeth.</p>

<p><i>c. Carbonates of lime and magnesia; vegetable ashes.</i>&mdash;Carbonic
acid is always evolved, upon treating flour with hydrochloric
acid. If the base present be calcium, upon adding oxalate
of ammonia to the filtered solution&mdash;which has previously
been neutralized with ammonia&mdash;a white precipitate, possessing
the properties mentioned above, will be formed; in case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the base is magnesia, the addition of oxalate of ammonia will
fail to cause a precipitate, but upon adding solution of
phosphate of ammonia to the fluid a granular precipitate of
phosphate of ammonia and magnesia is produced; if, finally,
the flour contains vegetable ashes&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> carbonates of the alkalies&mdash;bichloride
of platinum will produce in the acid solution
a yellow precipitate: the addition of vegetable ashes, moreover,
would render the ash of the flour deliquescent and very strongly
alkaline.</p>

<p><i>d. Lime.</i>&mdash;In presence of lime, carbonic acid produces a
white precipitate, when conducted into the filtered aqueous
extract of the flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><i>e. Plaster.</i>&mdash;The flour is boiled with water acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, the fluid filtered, and lime detected in the filtrate
by means of ammonia and oxalate of ammonia. The
presence of sulphuric acid is indicated by the formation of a
precipitate insoluble in acids, upon addition of solution of
chloride of barium. Upon calcining the flour without access
of air, sulphate of lime is converted into the corresponding
sulphide: the residue of the calcination, when treated with
hydrochloric acid, evolves sulphuretted hydrogen, and the lime
present in the filtered acid solution is likewise precipitated by
the addition of ammonia and oxalate of ammonia.</p>

<p><i>f. Alum.</i>&mdash;A portion of the flour to be examined is treated
with water, the fluid filtered, and the filtrate divided in two
portions: in one, sulphuric acid is detected by means of chloride
of barium; in the other, alumina by adding a solution of
potassa, which gives with its salts a white gelatinous precipitate,
soluble in an excess of the <span class="locked">reagent.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18" href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>g. Sulphate of copper.</i>&mdash;About 200 grammes of the bread under
examination are incinerated; the ash treated with nitric acid;
the mixture evaporated until it acquires a sticky consistence,
and the mass then taken up with water. The aqueous solution
is next filtered; an excess of ammonia and several drops
of solution of carbonate of ammonia added; the fluid again
filtered, the filtrate slightly acidulated with nitric acid, and
divided into two parts. It is then ascertained if sulphuretted
hydrogen produces in one portion of the solution a brown
precipitate of sulphide of copper, and if solution of ferrocyanide
of potassium produces in the other a reddish-brown precipitate
of ferrocyanide of <span class="locked">copper.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"
href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></span></p>

<h4>FIXED OILS.</h4>

<p>Olive oil designed for table use is frequently adulterated
with the oils of poppy, sesamé, cotton-seed, pea-nuts, and
other nuts; olive oil, intended for manufacturing purposes,
is often mixed with colza and nut oils.</p>

<p>The tests used are of a rather unsatisfactory character.
In all instances, when the chemist is called upon to pronounce
as to the adulteration of an oil, it is necessary to
execute comparative experiments with the pure oil, and with
admixtures arbitrarily prepared: it is only when this is
done that the indications obtained are of value.</p>


<h5>EXAMINATION OF OLIVE OIL INTENDED FOR TABLE USE.</h5>

<p><i>a.</i> The density of the oil is determined by means of a
hydrometer (<i>oleometer</i>) provided with a scale giving the densities
from 0.8 to 0.94, for the temperature of 15.° Pure olive
oil possesses a specific gravity of 0.917; poppy oil one of
0.925; a mixture of the two, an intermediate density. Since
the fixed oils are not definite chemical compounds, this test is
seldom conclusive.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Two or three cubic centimetres of concentrated nitric
acid, containing nitric peroxide in solution (or a solution of
mercury in strong nitric acid), are added to the oil to be examined,
as well as to a sample of pure olive oil. The two
samples are then allowed to stand in a room where the temperature
does not exceed 10.° The <i>oleine</i> of the olive oil is
converted into solid <i>elaidine</i>, and the mixture after some time
becomes sufficiently thick to remain in the vessel upon inversion.
If the sample under examination is free from adulteration,
it will solidify at the same time as the pure oil; whereas,
the presence of one per cent. of poppy oil, or of other drying
oils, suffices to retard the solidification for forty minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> Fifteen grammes of the oil are mixed in a glass vessel
with the same amount of strong sulphuric acid, the temperature
of the two liquids being previously observed. The mixture
is stirred with a thermometer, and the maximum temperature
noted: pure olive oil produces an elevation of temperature
of 37.°7; pure poppy oil, an elevation of 70.°5; and a
mixture of the two an elevation of temperature intermediate
between 37.°7 and 70.°5.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> One volume of nitric acid of sp. gr. 1.33 is agitated
with 5 grammes of the oil, and notice taken of the coloration
produced after the lapse of five minutes. If the olive oil is
pure, it acquires a pale green color; in case it is mixed with
sesamé or nut oil, a deep-red color appears: poppy oil also
communicates a reddish coloration, but one less deep than the
preceding.</p>

<p>If an acid of sp. gr. 1.22 is taken, it is still less difficult
to distinguish between sesamé, nut and poppy oils; the latter
assumes, in this case, a pale yellowish-red color.</p>

<p>Pea-nut oil fails to exhibit a coloration; but can be
recognized by its conversion into a white solid, when mixed
with 1/5 of its volume of a solution of caustic soda of sp. gr.
1.34.</p>


<h5>EXAMINATION OF OLIVE OIL INTENDED FOR MANUFACTURING
PURPOSES.</h5>

<p>The chief adulterations are colza and nut oils. The latter
is detected by means of the reaction with nitric acid, as described
above. Colza oil is recognized by mixing 5 volumes of
the sample to be examined, with 1 volume of sulphuric acid
of sp. gr. 1.655: if colza or nut oils are present, a brown
coloration ensues; under the same circumstances, pure olive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
oil assumes a pale greenish hue. In case the sample acquires
a brown color when treated with sulphuric acid, and
a red coloration is produced by the addition of nitric acid, it
contains nut oil; if sulphuric acid produces a brown coloration,
and nitric acid fails to change it, the presence of oil of
colza is indicated.</p>


<h5>EXAMINATION OF HEMPSEED OIL.</h5>

<p>This oil is frequently adulterated with linseed oil. The
reactions exhibited by these oils are nearly identical, and the
detection of the admixture is extremely difficult. It is advisable
to mix the suspected oil with sulphuric acid, notice being
taken of the elevation of temperature produced, and to treat
it with nitric acid and with dilute potassa solution, subjecting,
at the same time, an artificial mixture of the two pure oils
to the same treatment, and comparing the results obtained.</p>


<h4>TEA AND ITS ADULTERATION.</h4>

<p>Among alimentary substances probably no article is
subjected to more adulteration than tea. The sophistications
practised may be conveniently divided into three
classes:</p>

<p>1. Additions made for the purpose of giving increased
bulk and weight, which include foreign leaves and exhausted
tea-leaves, and also certain mineral substances,
such as metallic iron, sand, brick-dust, etc.</p>

<p>2. Substances added in order to produce an artificial
appearance of strength in the tea decoction, catechu, or
other bodies rich in tannin, and iron salts being chiefly
resorted to for this purpose.</p>

<p>3. The imparting of a bright and shining appearance to
the tea by means of various coloring mixtures or "facings,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which adulteration, while sometimes practised upon black
tea, is much more common with the green variety. This
sophistication involves the use of steatite (soap-stone),
sulphate of lime, China clay, Prussian blue, indigo, turmeric,
and graphite; chromate of lead and copper salts
being but very rarely employed. The compound most
frequently used consists of a mixture of soap-stone (or
gypsum) with Prussian blue, to which a little turmeric is
sometimes added.</p>

<p>Genuine tea is the prepared leaf of <i>Thea
sinensis</i>. It contains: moisture, 6% to 10%;
theine, 0.4% to 4.0%; tannin, (green) 20%,
(black) 10%; ash, 5% to 6%; soluble extractive
matters, 32% to 50%; and insoluble leaf,
47% to 54%.</p>

</div>
<p>The presence of foreign leaves, and, in some
instances, of mineral adulterants, in tea is
best detected by means of a microscopic examination
of the suspected sample. The genuine
tea-leaf is characterized by its peculiar
serrations and venations. Its border exhibits
serrations which stop a little short of the
stalk, while the venations extend from the
central rib, nearly parallel to one another,
but turn just before reaching the border of the leaf (see
Fig. 16). The Chinese are said to employ ash, plum, camellia,
velonia, and dog-rose leaves for admixture with tea,
and the product is stated to be often subjected in England
to the addition of the leaves of willow, sloe, beech, hawthorn,
elm, box-poplar, horse-chestnut, and fancy oak (see
Figs. 17, 18, and 19). For scenting purposes chulan flowers,
rose, jasmine, and orange leaves are frequently em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>ployed.
In the microscopic examination the sample should
be moistened with hot water, spread out upon a glass plate,
and then submitted to a careful inspection, especial attention
being given to the general outline of the leaf and its
serrations and venations. Most foreign leaves will, in this
way, be identified by their botanical character. The presence
of exhausted tea-leaves may also often be detected by
their soft and disintegrated appearance. If a considerable
quantity of the tea be placed in a long glass cylinder and
agitated with water, the coloring and other abnormal bodies
present frequently become detached, and either rise to the
surface of the liquid as a sort of scum or fall to the bottom
as a deposit. In this way Prussian blue, indigo, soap-stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
gypsum, sand, and turmeric can sometimes be separated
and subsequently recognized by their characteristic microscopic
appearance. The separated substances should also
be chemically tested. Prussian blue is detected by heating
with a solution of caustic soda, filtering, and acidulating
the filtrate with acid, and then adding chloride of
iron, when, in its presence, a blue color will be produced.
Indigo is best discovered by its appearance under the
microscope; it is not decolorized by caustic alkali, but it
dissolves in sulphuric acid to a blue liquid. Soap-stone,
gypsum, sand, metallic iron, etc., are identified by means of
the usual chemical tests. A compound, very aptly termed
"Lie-tea," is often met with. It forms little pellets consisting
of tea-dust mixed with foreign leaves, sand, etc.,
and held together by means of gum or starch. This, when
treated with boiling water, falls to powder. In the presence
of catechu the tea infusion usually becomes muddy upon
cooling; in case iron salts have been employed to deepen
the color of the liquor, they can be detected by treating
the ground tea-leaves with acetic acid and testing the solution
with ferrocyanide of potassium. Tea should not turn
black upon immersion in hydrosulphuric acid water, nor
should it impart a blue color to ammonia solution. The
infusion should be amber-colored, and not become reddened
by the addition of an acid.</p>



<p class="center p2"><b>TEA ASSAY.</b></p>

<p>In the following tea assay proper the estimation of theine
is not included. The processes suggested for this determination
are rather unsatisfactory; and there appears, moreover,
to exist no direct relation between the quality of tea
and the proportion of theine contained. The tests here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
mentioned, in connection with those already given, will,
it is believed, usually suffice to indicate to the analyst the
presence of spent leaves, inorganic coloring matters, and
other mineral adulterations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tannin.</span>&mdash;A good process for the estimation of tannin in
tea has been published by Allen (<i>Chem. News</i>, vol. xxix.
p. 169 et seq.) A standard solution of lead acetate is prepared
by dissolving 5 grammes of the salt in distilled water
and diluting the liquid to 1,000 c.c. As an indicator, 5
milligrammes of potassic ferricyanide are dissolved in 5 c.c.
of water, and an equal volume of strong ammonia-water
added. The exact strength of the lead solution is to be
determined by means of a solution of pure tannin of known
strength. Two grammes of the tea to be tested are powdered,
boiled with water, and, after filtering and thorough
washing, the decoction is made up to a volume of 250 c.c.;
10 c.c. of the lead solution are now diluted with 90 c.c.
of boiling water, and the tea infusion is gradually added
from a burette until a few drops of the liquid, when filtered
and added to a little of the indicator placed upon a porcelain
slab, causes a pink coloration to appear; 125, divided
by the number of c.c. of tea infusion found to be necessary
to produce the pink color, will give directly the percentage
of tannin in the sample examined. As previously stated,
green tea contains 20% of tannin, and black tea 10%. In
spent tea, however, only about 2% of tannin is present;
and, although any tea deficient in this constituent could
be fortified by the addition of catechu, its determination
often affords indications of value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ash</span>&mdash;<i>a. Total Ash.</i>&mdash;5 grammes of the sample are
placed in a platinum vessel and heated over a Bunsen
burner until complete incineration has been accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
The vessel is allowed to cool in a desiccator, and is then
weighed as quickly as possible. In genuine tea the total
ash should not be much below 5% or much above 6%, and
it should not be magnetic; in "faced" teas the proportion
of total ash is often 10% or 15%; in "lie-tea" it may
reach 30%, and in spent leaves it may fall as low as 3%, the
ash in this case being abnormally rich in lime salts and
poor in potash salts. Tea-dust sometimes contains 10% of
total ash without necessarily being considered bad in quality.
In the proposed United States tea-adulteration law (1884)
a maximum of 8% of total ash is allowed for tea-leaf.</p>

<p><i>b. Ash insoluble in water.</i>&mdash;The total ash obtained in <i>a</i>
is washed into a beaker and boiled with water for a considerable
time. It is then brought upon a filter and the
insoluble residue washed, dried, ignited, and weighed. In
unadulterated tea it will not exceed 3% of the sample
taken.</p>

<p><i>c. Ash soluble in water.</i>&mdash;This proportion is obtained by
deducting ash insoluble in water from the total ash.
Genuine tea contains from 3% to 3.5% of soluble ash, or at
least 50% of the total ash, whereas in spent or exhausted
tea the amount is often but 0.5%.</p>

<p><i>d. Ash insoluble in acid.</i>&mdash;The ash insoluble in water is
boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid and the residue separated
by filtration, washed, ignited, and weighed. In pure
tea the remaining ash ranges between 0.3% and 0.8%; in
"faced" teas, or in teas adulterated by the addition of
sand, etc., it may reach the proportion of 2% to 5%. Fragments
of silica and brick-dust are occasionally to be found
in the ash insoluble in acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Extract.</span>&mdash;Two grammes of the carefully-sampled
tea are boiled with water until all soluble matter is dissolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
water being added from time to time to prevent the solution
becoming too concentrated. The solution is poured upon
a tared filter, and the remaining insoluble leaf repeatedly
washed with hot water until the filtered liquid becomes
colorless. The filtrate is now diluted to a volume of 200
c.c., and of this 50 c.c. are taken and evaporated in a
weighed dish over the steam-bath until the weight of the
extract remains constant; its weight is then determined.
Genuine tea affords from 32% to 50% of extract, according
to its age and quality; in spent tea the proportion of
extract will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Insoluble Leaf.</span>&mdash;The insoluble leaf obtained in the
preceding operation, together with the weighed filter, is
placed in an air-bath and dried for at least eight hours at a
temperature of 110° C.; its weight is then determined. In
unadulterated tea the amount of insoluble leaf ranges between
47% and 54%; in exhausted tea it may reach a proportion
of 75%.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in the foregoing estimations the
tea is taken in its ordinary air-dried condition. If it be
desired to reduce the results obtained to a dry basis, an
allowance for the moisture present in the sample (an
average of 8%), or a direct determination of the same, must
be made.</p>

<p>The following tabulation gives the constituents of genuine
tea so far as the ash, extract, and insoluble leaf are
involved:</p>

<ul class="app">
 <li><i>Total ash</i>&mdash;ranges between 4.7% and 6.2%.</li>
 <li><i>Ash soluble in water</i>&mdash;ranges between 3% and 3.5%; should equal 50% of total ash.</li>
 <li><i>Ash insoluble in water</i>&mdash;not over 2.75%.</li>
 <li><i>Ash insoluble in acid</i>&mdash;ranges between 0.3% and 0.8%.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></li>
 <li><i>Extract</i>&mdash;ranges between 32% and 48%.</li>
 <li><i>Insoluble leaf</i>&mdash;ranges between 43% and 58%.</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below may prove useful as indicating the requirements
to be exacted when the chemist is asked to give
an opinion concerning the presence of facing admixtures
or of exhausted or foreign leaves in a sample of tea:</p>

<ul  class="app">
 <li><i>Total ash</i>&mdash;should not be under 4.5% or over 7%.</li>
 <li><i>Ash soluble in water</i>&mdash;should not be under 40% of total ash.</li>

 <li><i>Ash insoluble in acid</i>&mdash;should not be over 1%.</li>
 <li><i>Extract</i>&mdash;should not be under 30%.</li>
 <li><i>Insoluble leaf</i>&mdash;should not be over 60%.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The British Society of Public Analysts adopt:</p>

<ul class="app">
<li><i>Total Ash</i> (dry basis)&mdash;not over 8% (at least 3% should be soluble in water).</li>
<li><i>Extract</i> (tea as sold)&mdash;not under 30%.</li>
</ul>


<h4>MILK.</h4>

<p>The chief constituents of milk are water, butter, caseine,
lactose (milk-sugar), traces of albumen and mineral salts.
Butter is present in the form of minute globules, held in suspension;
the caseine, for the greater part, is in solution, only
a small portion being present in an insoluble suspended condition.
In milk only a few days old, the <i>colostrum</i> (the milk
secreted during the first few days after parturition) consists
largely of rather voluminous cellular conglomerations, containing
a sufficient quantity of albumen to coagulate upon
heating.</p>

<p>The normal density of milk is 1.030, water being 1.000;
the density rising to 1.036, if the fluid has been skimmed.</p>

<p>Good milk contains, on an average, 3.7 per cent. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
butter; 5.7 per cent. of lactose, and leaves upon evaporation
12 to 14 per cent. of solid <span class="locked">matters.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20" href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> </span>The most common
adulteration of milk consists in the addition of water. This
fraud is detected by means of an areometer (<i>lactodensimeter</i>)
which gives directly the specific gravity of the fluid under
examination. Should the density be much below 1.030, it is
certain that water has been added. It does not, however,
necessarily follow if it is about 1.030 that the milk is pure,
since the gravity of the fluid, which would be increased upon
skimming, could be subsequently reduced to 1.030 by the
addition of water. The lactodensimeter, therefore, although
useful in the detection of a simple admixture, fails to give
reliable results if the fraud perpetrated is a double one; and
a determination of the proportion of butter present is also
usually necessary. Numerous methods have been proposed
to accomplish this estimation. The most preferable of these,
owing to the rapidity with which the operation is executed, is
the use of the lactoscope (<i>galactoscope</i>). This instrument consists
of a tube provided with a glass plate fitted at one end,
and with a movable glass plate at the other extremity. A few
drops of the milk to be tested are placed between the two
plates, and the tube lengthened, by screwing out the movable
plate, until the fluid no longer transmits the light of a candle
placed at a distance of one metre. As the opacity of milk is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
due to the butter present, it is evident that the proportion of
this substance contained in the sample can be estimated by
the relative distance which the plates have been separated.</p>


<p>The lactoscope possesses, however, but a limited degree of
precision. <i>M. Marchand</i> substitutes to its use the following
tests: A test-tube is graduated in three equal divisions, the
upper one being subdivided into hundredths extending above,
in order to determine accurately the correct volume of the
fluid, expanded, as it is, by the temperature of 40°, at which
the examination is executed. The first division of the tube is
filled with milk, a drop, or two of strong potassa lye added,
and the mixture well shaken: the second portion is then filled
with ether, and the third with alcohol. The mixture is next
again thoroughly agitated, and then exposed to a temperature
of 40° in a water-bath. After standing for several hours, a
layer of fatty matter becomes sufficiently separated to allow of
measurement: but, as it contains some ether and as a small
amount of butter may still be retained in the lower aqueous
fluid, a correction of the results obtained is necessary. M.
Marchand has compiled a table, which facilitates this correction
(<i>vide</i>: <i>Journ. de Pharm., Novembre 1854</i>, and <i>Bulletin de
l'Académie de Médecine, Paris, 1854</i>, xix., p. 1101).</p>

<p>Previously to the introduction of Marchand's apparatus,
use was made of the <i>lactometer</i>, which consists simply of a graduated
glass tube, in which the suspected milk is allowed to remain
for 24 hours, at a temperature of 15°. After the lapse of
this time, the cream present completely separates as a supernatant
layer, the thickness of which indicates the quality of the
sample taken.</p>

<p><i>M. Lacomte</i> recommends the addition of glacial acetic acid,
in order to cause the more rapid separation of the cream.</p>

<p>The estimation of the butter being accomplished, it is fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>quently
needful to determine the amount of lactose present.
For this purpose, recourse is had to Barreswil's method,
based upon the reduction of cupro-potassic tartrate by milk-sugar
in the presence of alkalies. A solution is prepared containing
40 grammes of pure crystallized sulphate of copper, 600
or 700 grammes of caustic soda lye of sp. gr. 1.12, and 160 grammes
of neutral tartrate of potassa. The sulphate of copper and
tartrate of potassa are previously dissolved separately in a little
water, the three solutions united, and water added until the
fluid acquires a volume of 1154.4 cubic centimetres. In order
to standardize this test solution, a known weight of pure lactose
is dissolved in water and the fluid added, drop by drop, from a
graduated burette, to a small flask containing 10 cubic centimetres
of the copper solution, diluted with 40 cubic centimetres
of distilled water, and heated to boiling. At first a yellow
precipitate forms, which gradually turns red, and is deposited
on the bottom of the flask, leaving the solution colorless. As
soon as the test solution is completely decolorized, the addition
of the lactose solution is discontinued, and the weight of
lactose corresponding to 10 cubic centimetres of the test fluid
calculated from the quantity used. The standard of the test
solution having been determined, the above operation is repeated,
the milk under examination being substituted for the solution
of pure lactose. The quantity of milk necessary to decolorize
10 cubic centimetres of the copper solution will
evidently contain the same amount of lactose as the quantity
of solution used in the preliminary test, and the actual amount
of lactose present is very easily calculated. When an estimation
of the solid matter contained in the milk is required, a
known weight is evaporated to dryness over a water-bath, and
the residue weighed. In performing this evaporation, the addition
of a known amount of sand, or ground glass, is advisable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The amount of ash present is determined by incinerating the
residue left by the evaporation.</p>

<p>Foreign substances are sometimes added to milk, for the
purpose of disguising the presence of an abnormal quantity of
water, the principal of which are: chalk, bicarbonate of soda,
emulsion of almonds, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, starch, flour,
decoction of barley or rice, sugar, and cerebral substances.
These bodies are detected as follows:</p>

<p><i>Chalk.</i>&mdash;If chalk is contained in the milk, it readily subsides
upon allowing the sample to remain at rest for some
time in a flask, forming a deposit which effervesces when
heated with hydrochloric acid, and dissolves to a solution, in
which the characteristic properties of a lime salt can be recognized.</p>

<p><i>Bicarbonate of soda.</i>&mdash;In presence of this compound the
milk possesses a strongly alkaline reaction, furnishes a serum
having a sharp and bitter taste, and leaves a residue of the
salt upon evaporation.</p>

<p><i>Emulsion of almonds.</i>&mdash;The milk has a specific gravity of
at least, 1.033. If it is passed through a gauze, small opaque
lumps are separated. When examined under the microscope,
numerous minute globules, having a diameter of 1/400 of a millimetre,
are observed, and, upon adding a few centigrammes of
amygdaline to one or two grammes of the milk, the characteristic
odor of bitter almonds is produced.</p>

<p><i>Gum tragacanth.</i>&mdash;When shaken in a glass flask and allowed
to rest, the milk deposits on the sides small transparent
lumps, which usually present a slightly elongated or angular
form.</p>

<p><i>Gum arabic.</i>&mdash;The addition of alcohol produces an abundant
white opaque precipitate.</p>

<p><i>Starch, flour, decoction of barley, rice, etc.</i>&mdash;Upon boiling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
suspected milk, and adding tincture of iodine, the amylaceous
substances present produce a blue coloration in the fluid.</p>

<p><i>Sugar.</i>&mdash;If yeast is added, and the mixture allowed to
stand for some time at a temperature of 30°, alcoholic fermentation
ensues; under these circumstances, lactose does not
undergo fermentation.</p>

<p><i>Cerebral substances.</i>&mdash;Adulteration by these substances is
probably of much less frequent occurrence than was formerly
supposed. The admixture is detected by evaporating the milk
to dryness, dissolving the residue in ether, evaporating the
etherial solution, and fusing the second residue, which consists
of fatty matters, with nitrate of potassa in a platinum
crucible. The mass is then taken up with water, and chloride
of barium added to the solution. If cerebral substances were
contained in the milk, ether will dissolve the fatty matters
present, the phosphorus of which is converted into a soluble
phosphate by the calcination with nitrate of potassa and is
thrown down as a white precipitate, upon the addition of a solution
of chloride of barium. This test may be confirmed by a
microscopic examination of the milk, when the peculiar appearance
of cerebral matter will be <span class="locked">detected.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21" href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></span></p>



<h4>WINE.</h4>

<p>The most common adulteration to which wines are subjected
is the addition of water: wines having a rich color are
frequently mixed by the dealer with lighter wines, and the
fraud consummated by adding water. The detection of this
adulteration is somewhat difficult, as water is a normal constituent
of wine. In Paris the following method is usually
employed: As soon as the wine is confiscated, it is ascer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>tained
what kinds of wine are manufactured by the inculpated
dealer, and a statement obtained from him, giving the proportions
of alcohol, etc., contained in the various brands. A wine
is then prepared, according to the information received, an estimation
of the alcohol contained in the prepared sample made,
and the results compared with those furnished by a similar examination
of the suspected wine. In case the proportion of
alcohol is less in the suspected wine than in the prepared
sample, it is evident that a fraudulent adulteration has been
committed. If, however, the quantity of alcohol is the same
in both wines, it does not necessarily follow that the wine has
escaped admixture, since this body may have been added after
the adulteration with water. In addition to the estimation
of alcohol, it is also necessary to determine the amount of
cream of tartar (bitartrate of potassa) present, as the proportion
of this salt would be sensibly decreased by the addition
of alcohol and water to the wine. This fraud could,
however, be disguised by subsequently adding the proper
amount of cream of tartar.</p>

<p>It is also well to ascertain if two equal quantities of the
prepared sample and the wine under examination require the
same amount of solution of hypochlorite of lime for decolorization.
In case the suspected wine has been adulterated,
the quantity of hypochlorite solution used will be less than
the amount necessary to decolorize the prepared wine. Foreign
coloring matter may be added by the adulterator, but
this fraud is easily detected by adding potassa to the sample:
if its coloration is natural, a green tint is produced; whereas,
if foreign matter has been introduced, the wine assumes various
other colors upon the addition of the <span class="locked">alkali.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22" href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The indications furnished by the above test are rendered
valueless, if the wine has been artificially colored by the addition
of the coloring matter of grape-skins; but the execution
of this fraud would require some knowledge of chemistry,
and fortunately adulterators, as a class, are deficient in this
branch of science.</p>

<p>Another method for detecting the addition of water is
based upon the fact that fermented liquors do not contain air
in solution, but only carbonic acid; whereas, water dissolves
oxygen and nitrogen. It is executed as follows:</p>

<p>The wine to be tested is placed in a flask, the delivery-tube
of which is also filled, and heated; the evolved gas being
collected in a tube filled with mercury. In case the
wine is pure, the disengaged gas will be completely absorbed
by potassa; if, on the other hand, water has been added, an
unabsorbed residue, consisting of oxygen and nitrogen, will
remain.</p>

<p>This test is useless in case water, through which a current
of carbonic acid gas has been passed for a considerable time,
has been employed. Under these circumstances, however, the
presence of the gas would probably be detected by the taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the wine, as well as by the estimation just mentioned, since
the sample would invariably contain a larger proportion of the
gas than the standard with which it is compared; indeed, it
would be almost impossible to prepare a solution which contained
exactly the proportion of carbonic acid ordinarily
present in wine.</p>

<p>It remains to mention the methods employed in determining
the amount of alcohol and cream of tartar contained in
wine.</p>

<p>The alcometrical method usually employed is based upon
the difference in density possessed by pure alcohol and by
mixtures of alcohol and water. <i>Gay-Lussac</i> has proposed an
areometer (<i>alcoholmeter</i>), provided with a scale which directly
indicates the proportion of alcohol contained in a mixture.
As the indications furnished by this instrument vary with the
temperature, and the scale is constructed on the basis of
a temperature of 15°, a correction of the results obtained
is necessary if the determination is made at other temperatures.
Gay-Lussac has compiled a table which indicates
at once the required correction; the following formula can
also be used: <i>x = c ± 0.4 t</i>, where <i>x</i> is the quantity
of alcohol present in the sample; <i>c</i> the degree indicated
by the alcoholmeter, and <i>t</i> the number of degrees differing
from the temperature of 15°: the second member of the
formula is subtracted from, or added to the first, as the temperature
at which the estimation is made is greater or less
than <span class="locked">15°.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23" href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></span></p>



<p>In case the wine to be examined contains substances other
than water and alcohol, which would affect its density, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
necessary, before making use of the alcoholmeter, to distil the
sample and subsequently examine the distillate, which will consist
of a simple mixture of water and alcohol. Usually the
distillation is discontinued as soon as one-third of the sample
has passed over, and a quantity of distilled water, sufficient
to render the volume of the mixture equal to the original
volume of the wine, added to the distillate: the fluid remaining
in the flask will be entirely free from alcohol. The
addition of water to the distillate is not indispensable, but
otherwise it is necessary to divide the degrees indicated by
the alcoholmeter by 3, in order to reduce the result to the
original volume of the wine taken.</p>

<p><i>M. Salleron</i> offers for
sale a small apparatus
(Fig. 20) used in examinations
of this character,
consisting of a flask,
closed with a gutta-percha
cork, containing a
tube which connects with
a worm passing through
a cooler. The flask is
supported by an iron
stand, and heated with a
gas or spirit lamp.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the cream of tartar, the wine is evaporated
to the consistency of an extract, alcohol of 82° B. added,
and the residue obtained calcined in a crucible. The amount
of salt present in the fused mass is then determined by the
alkalimetric method, as directed in all works on quantitative
analysis. The carbonate obtained from 1 gr. of cream of
tartar exactly saturates 9.75 cubic centimetres of a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
containing 100 grammes of sulphuric acid of 66° B., and 1800
grammes of distilled water.</p>

<p>The detection of toxical substances, often contained in
wine, is accomplished by the methods described under the
head of detection of poisons.</p>


<h4>VINEGAR.</h4>

<p>Vinegar is frequently adulterated with water, and occasionally
sulphuric acid is added to artificially increase its
acidity.</p>

<p>The ordinary reagents&mdash;such as chloride of barium, or
nitrate of silver&mdash;are not adapted to the direct detection of
sulphuric acid, or of other mineral acids, as sulphates and
chlorides, which are as readily precipitated as the free acids,
may also be present.</p>

<p>The following method, proposed by <i>M. Payen</i>, is usually
employed:</p>

<p>Five centigrammes of starch (fecula) are added to a decilitre
of table vinegar, the mixture boiled for 12 or 15 minutes, and,
after the fluid has become <i>completely cooled</i>, a few drops of
iodine solution added: dilute acetic acid does not affect
starch, and, in case the vinegar is pure, a blue coloration is
produced; if, on the other hand, even a minute quantity of a
mineral acid be present, the starch is converted into dextrine,
and the addition of iodine fails to cause a blue coloration.</p>

<p>The water present is indirectly estimated by determining
the amount of acetic acid contained in the vinegar. This can
be accomplished in different ways: either the quantity of a
standard solution of an alkali, necessary to exactly neutralize
a measured quantity of the vinegar, is ascertained, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the vinegar is supersaturated with solution of baryta, the excess
of the salt eliminated by conducting carbonic acid
through the fluid, the precipitate removed by filtration, and
the baryta salt in the filtrate precipitated by the addition of
sulphuric acid. The second precipitate is then collected on a
filter, washed, weighed, and the amount of acetic acid present
calculated: this is done by multiplying its weight by 0.515.</p>


<h4>SULPHATE OF QUININE.</h4>

<p>Owing to the high price of this salt, it is frequently adulterated.
The substances used for this purpose are: crystalline
sulphate of lime, boric acid, mannite, sugar, starch, salicine,
stearic acid, and the sulphates of cinchonine and quinidine.
These bodies are detected as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Upon slightly warming 2 grammes of sulphate of quinine
with 120 grammes of alcohol of 21° B., the pure salt completely
dissolves; if, however, starch, magnesia, mineral salts, or various
other foreign substances are present, they are left as
insoluble residues.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Those mineral substances that are soluble in alcohol
are detected by calcining the suspected sample: pure sulphate
of quinine is completely consumed; whereas, the mineral
substances present remain behind as a residue.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> In presence of salicine, the salt acquires a deep red color,
when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Stearic acid remains undissolved upon treating sulphate
of quinine with acidulated water.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> To detect sugar and mannite, the sample is dissolved in
acidulated water, and an excess of hydrate of baryta added:
a precipitate, consisting of quinine and sulphate of baryta, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
produced. Carbonic acid is then passed through the fluid, in
order to precipitate the excess of baryta as insoluble carbonate,
the fluid saturated with ammonia, to throw down the
quinine which may have been re-dissolved by the carbonic
acid, and the mixture filtered. If the salt be pure, no residue
will be obtained upon evaporating the filtrate; a residue of
sugar or mannite is formed, if these substances are present.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Sulphate of quinine invariably contains 2 or 3 per cent.
of cinchonine, originating, not from a fraudulent admixture,
but from an incomplete purification of the salt. One of the
best methods for detecting the respective quantities of quinine
and cinchonine, present in a sample of the sulphate, is the following:
Several grammes of ammonia and ether (which has previously
been washed with water) are added to one or two grammes
of the salt under examination, the mixture thoroughly agitated,
and then allowed to remain at rest. The supernatant etherial
solution contains all of the quinine; the cinchonine, which is
almost completely insoluble, both in water and ether, remaining
suspended between the layers of the two fluids. The
ether is next removed by means of a stop-cock funnel, evaporated
to dryness, and the weight of the residue obtained determined.
The operation is then repeated, the ether being
replaced by chloroform in which both quinine and cinchonine
are soluble. The residue, formed by the evaporation of the
second solution, will be heavier than the first residue: the
difference between the two weighings gives the weight of the
cinchonine present.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> The detection of the presence of sulphate of quinidine
is based upon the difference in the solubilities of the oxalates
of quinine and quinidine. Oxalate of quinidine is sufficiently
soluble in cold water not to be precipitated by double decomposition
when solutions of oxalate of ammonia and sul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>phate
of quinidine are mixed. Under the same circumstances,
quinine is almost completely thrown down. The
test is applied as follows:</p>

<p>The suspected salt is dissolved in water, a slight excess of
oxalate of ammonia added, and the precipitate formed separated
by filtration. If the salt be pure, the filtrate is scarcely
rendered turbid by the addition of ammonia; when, however,
sulphate of quinidine is present, it will be entirely contained
in the filtrate, in which ammonia will produce an abundant
precipitate.</p>


<h3>EXAMINATION OF BLOOD STAINS.</h3>

<p>This branch of legal chemistry formerly gave but very unreliable
results. It is scarcely ten years since the reactions
that are now regarded as only secondary and confirmative in
their character, and far from conclusive, were the only ones in
use: these are the tests based upon the presence of iron and
albumen in the blood. Since then, great progress has been
made in the methods employed. It must not be understood,
however, that the question under consideration always admits
of an easy and decisive solution: the stains are sometimes
too greatly altered to be identified; but in cases where the distinctive
reactions of blood can be produced, the real nature of
the stains under examination can, at present, be determined
with certainty.</p>

<p>The tests more recently introduced consist in the production
of small characteristic crystals, termed <i>haemin</i> crystals,
and in the use of the spectroscope. Crystals of haemin (first
discovered by <i>Teichman</i>) are formed when dry blood is dissolved
in concentrated acetic acid, and the solution evaporated
to dryness: they are of a brownish-red color. <i>Brücke</i> first
suggested an analytical method, based upon this property of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
blood, which is equally characteristic and sensitive: It is only
necessary to dissolve a minute portion of the matter to be examined
(dried blood, or the residue left by the evaporation of the
fluid obtained by treating the stain, or the dried blood, with
cold water) in glacial acetic acid and evaporate the solution to
dryness in order to obtain crystals of haemin, which can be
readily recognized by means of a microscope having a magnifying
power of 300 diameters. If the crystals originate from
fresh blood, they appear as represented in Fig. 21; crystals
from old blood are represented in Fig. 22.</p>





<p>The former possess a reddish-brown, the latter a lighter
color.</p>

<p>The various methods now employed to produce haemin
crystals were proposed by <i>Hoppe-Seyler</i>, by <i>Brücke</i> and by <i>Erdman</i>.
Whichever process is used, the suspected stains are at
first carefully separated from the material upon which they are
deposited. If they are present on linen, or other fabrics, the
stained portions, which always remain somewhat stiff, are cut
off: they will present a reddish-brown color, in case the cloth
is not dyed: if the stains are on wood, they are removed by
means of a sharp knife; if on stone or iron, they are detached
by scraping.</p>

<p>In case Hoppe-Seyler's method is used, the stains, separated
as directed above, are macerated with a little <i>cold</i> water (warm
water would coagulate the albumen present, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
prevent solution taking place): the stains become soft, striae
and brown or reddish clouds are observed, especially when
the dried blood is fresh, and, at the same time, the objects upon
which the stains were deposited are decolorized. Upon allowing
the fluid obtained in this way to spontaneously evaporate
on a watch-glass, a reddish brown or brownish residue is left,
from which the crystals of haemin are prepared in the following
manner: An almost imperceptible amount of common salt is
added to the residue, then, six to eight drops of concentrated
acetic acid, and the mass thoroughly mixed by stirring with a
small glass rod. The mixture is at first heated over a small
gas flame, then evaporated to dryness by the heat of a water-bath.
If the stains were produced by blood, a microscopic
examination of the residue will reveal the presence of haemin
crystals. This method presents an objection: if the stained
objects have been washed with warm water previously to the
examination, the albumen will be coagulated, and the blood
rendered insoluble; in this case, cold water will fail to dissolve
anything, and the residue will not produce crystals when
treated with acetic acid.</p>

<p>In order to remedy this difficulty Brücke operates directly
upon the stained woven or ligneous fibre, or the matter removed
from the stone or iron: The materials are boiled in a test-tube
with glacial acetic acid, the fluid decanted or filtered, a
trace of common salt added, and the liquid then evaporated
on a watch-glass at a temperature between 40 and 80°.
If the stains really originated from blood, haemin crystals will
now be easily perceptible upon examining the residue obtained
under the microscope.</p>

<p>The stained fabric, the matter removed from the stone or
iron, or the residue left by the solution with which the stains
have been treated, is placed on the glass, a trace of chloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of sodium added, and the whole covered with a thin glass plate.
A drop of acetic acid is then placed at the edge of the plates&mdash;between
which it is soon introduced by capillary attraction&mdash;and
the mixture allowed to rest in the cold for a few moments.
The mass is next brought into solution by slightly heating, and
is then evaporated by holding the plate at a considerable distance
above a gas burner. The fluid is examined from time
to time under the microscope: when it is sufficiently concentrated,
crystals, presenting the appearance represented in
Figs. 21 or 22, will be observed. These are especially well-defined,
if an insoluble substance is also present between the
plates&mdash;which prevents their adhering. The fluid collects by
capillary attraction at the points of contact of the plates as a
more or less colored layer, in which the crystals are deposited.</p>

<p>Should the above test fail to present distinctive indications
at first, one or two fresh drops of acetic acid are introduced
between the plates, and the examination is repeated. The result
is not to be regarded as negative, until several trials have
proved fruitless, as the stained portions are but slowly soluble,
and crystallization may have been prevented by the too rapid
evaporation of the acetic solution.</p>

<p>Haemin crystals, once seen, can hardly be confounded
with other substances; still, it is well to identify them by confirming
their insolubility in water, alcohol, and cold acetic acid,
as well as their instantaneous solubility in soda lye.</p>

<p>The addition of common salt is ordinarily superfluous, as
it is normally contained in the blood; but it is possible, if the
stains were washed with warm water, that, in addition to the
coagulation of the albumen, the solution of the salt may have
taken place, in which case crystals will fail to form. The
addition of salt is to remedy this possible contingency; albeit,
the delicacy of the test is not affected, even if crystals of chlo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>ride
of sodium are produced, as these are easily soluble in
water, and are readily distinguished from those of haemin by
aid of the microscope.</p>

<p>The indications furnished by means of the spectroscope are
less reliable than those given by the production of haemin
crystals; moreover, the spectroscopic examination requires favorable
weather for its execution. Still, the test should be
employed in all possible instances. The course pursued is
the following:</p>

<p>The aqueous fluid, with which the stains have been treated,
is placed in a watch glass, and evaporated <i>in vacuo</i> over
sulphuric acid; the last remaining portion of the fluid being
united in the bottom of the glass by causing it to collect in a
single drop. When the evaporation of fluid is completed, the
watch-glass is placed before the narrowed slit of a spectroscope,
and a ray of diffused light (or better, light reflected from
a heliostat) made to pass through the part of the glass containing
the residue. If the stains originate from blood, the absorption
lines of <i>haemoglobin</i>, consisting of two large dark
bands, to the right of the sodium line (<i>Frauenhofer's</i> line D),
will be observed in the spectrum. In case both of the above
tests fail to give positive results, it is almost certain that the
stains examined were not caused by blood. If, on the contrary,
the reactions were produced, scarcely any doubt exists as to the
presence of blood. Under these circumstances it is advisable to
confirm the results by means of the tests that have been previously
spoken of as being formerly exclusively employed;
these are the following:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> 1/2 to 1 c.&nbsp;c. of ozonized oil of turpentine, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> turpentine
which has been exposed to the air sufficiently long to acquire
the property of decolorizing water that is slightly tinted with
indigo&mdash;is introduced in a test-tube, and an equal volume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
tincture of guaiacum added (the latter tincture is prepared by
treating an inner portion of the resin with alcohol, until its
brownish color is changed to a brownish-yellow).</p>

<p>If upon adding some of the substance under examination
to the above mixture a clear blue coloration ensues, and the
insoluble matter thrown down possesses a deep blue color, the
presence of coloring matter of the blood is indicated. The
mixture also imparts a blue color to moistened spots from
which the blood stains have been as completely extracted as possible.

<p><i>b.</i> Upon heating the fluid obtained by treating the stains
with cold water in a test-tube, its brown or reddish color disappears,
and greyish-white flakes of coagulated albumen are
thrown down. The precipitate acquires a brick-red color,
when treated with an acid solution of nitrate of mercury containing
nitrous acid. The albumen is also coagulated by the
addition of nitric acid: it assumes a more or less yellow color,
if heated with a slight excess of the acid. Chlorine-water,
especially upon heating, likewise precipitates albumen in the
form of white flakes.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> If the fluid is acidulated with a few drops of acetic acid,
and a drop of ferrocyanide of potassium added, a white precipitate,
or, at least, turbidity is produced.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The flakes of albumen, separated by heating, dissolve
in caustic alkalies to a solution, from which they are re-precipitated
by nitric acid, or chlorine water.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Upon treating blood stains with chlorine-water, a solution
which contains chloride of iron, and acquires a red coloration
by the addition of sulphocyanide of potassium, is formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p><i>f.</i> Should the stains have failed to be affected by cold water
(which, as has already been remarked, is the case when they
have been previously washed with hot water), they are treated
with weak soda lye. Nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and chlorine
water will produce in the solution so obtained a white
precipitate, which exhibits the general properties of albumen
previously described. In case the stains are deposited upon
linen, it is necessary to replace the soda by ammonia, in
order to avoid dissolving the fabric.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Solutions of the alkalies, which dissolve the albumen,
leave the coloring matters intact, and consequently do not
decolorize the fabric. If the latter is afterwards subjected to
the action of hydrochloric acid, the coloring matter is dissolved,
forming a solution that leaves upon evaporation to dryness
a residue containing iron, which gives a blue coloration with
ferrocyanide of potassium, and a red coloration with sulphocyanide
of potassium.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> The coloring matter of blood dissolves in boiling alcohol,
to which sulphuric acid has been added, to a brown dichroic
fluid (appearing green by transmitted light, and red
by reflected light). A mixture of rust and blood exhibits the
same phenomenon.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> If substances containing blood are heated in a dry tube,
an odor resembling that of burnt horn is emitted. In case the
stained fabric is a substance that would produce this odor,
(such as wool, silk, or hair), the test naturally loses all value.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> If the fluid obtained by treating the stains either with
water or alkali is evaporated with a little carbonate of potassa,
and the residue heated, at first at 100°, then to redness, in a
glass tube to which a fresh quantity of carbonate of potassa
has been added, cyanide of potassium is formed. When cold,
the tube is cut above the part containing the fused mixture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the mass heated with iron-filings and water, the fluid filtered,
and the filtrate then acidulated with hydrochloric acid: ferrocyanide
of potassium will be present in the fluid, and
upon adding a drop of solution of perchloride of iron a
green, or blue, color will be produced, and a precipitate of
Prussian blue gradually thrown down.</p>

<p>If the stained cloth is non-nitrogenous (<i>per ex.</i>: hemp,
linen, or cotton), instead of treating it with water, it may be
heated until pulverulent, mixed with carbonate of potassa,
the mixture calcined, and the operation then completed as
just described. This test having given affirmative results, the
operations should be repeated with an unstained portion
of the cloth, to remove all doubt that the indications obtained
do not really originate from the fabric.</p>

<p>In the present state of science, it is impossible to discriminate
chemically between human and animal blood. <i>M. Barruel</i>,
it is true, is able, not only to accomplish this, but also to distinguish
the blood of the various species of animals by its
odor! But this test has a somewhat hypothetical value for
scientific purposes. In regard to the crystals of haemin, they
do not present sufficient difference to allow the blood of different
animals to be distinguished. We have not yet treated
of the globules. It often occurs that these minute organs are
so altered as to be no longer recognized in the microscopic examination;
when, however, the stains are tolerably recent, they
may be detected by examining the moistened stained cloth,
directly under the microscope: a discrimination between animal
and human blood is then possible: corpuscules of human
blood possess the greater size: those of the sheep, for instance,
have only one-half the diameter of the former. It is,
however, but seldom that this distinction can be made use <span class="locked">of.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25" href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a></span>

<h3>EXAMINATION OF SPERMATIC STAINS.</h3>

<p>In cases where attempt at violence, rape or pederasty
is suspected, the expert may be required to determine the
nature of stains found on clothing, sheets, etc. The fact that
the stains were produced by semen, may often be regarded,
<i>per se</i>, as criminating evidence. This class of investigation
possesses, therefore, considerable importance.</p>

<p><i>External appearance of the stains.</i>&mdash;Dry spermatic stains
are thin, and exhibit a greyish or, occasionally, a citron-yellow
color, if present on white cloth. In case the fabric is colored,
they appear whitish and, if on linen, present a glossy aspect.
They are translucid, when observed by transmitted light. If
the fabric, upon which the stains are deposited, is of a heavy
texture, they are visible only on one side: under all circumstances,
their circumference is irregular and undulated. These
indications, however, are not conclusive, but vary according to
whether the stains were produced by the thick semen of a
vigorous man, or the aqueous seminal fluid of an aged and
diseased person, or by semen more or less mixed with the
prostatic fluid. Upon moistening spermatic stains, the distinctive
stale odor of fresh semen is sometimes emitted, but
this characteristic is usually obscured by the presence of foreign
substances.</p>

<p>Semen stains are soluble in water, forming a gummy fluid,
in which chlorine, alcohol, bichloride of mercury, acetate and
subacetate of lead produce a white precipitate, but which fails
to be coagulated by heating. Plumbate of potassa does not
impart a fawn-color to these stains, at a temperature above
20°, as is the case with those produced by albuminous substances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Persulphate of iron imparts to spermatic stains a pale
yellow color,</p>

<p>Sulphate of copper, a bluish grey color,</p>

<p>Cupro-potassic tartrate, a bluish grey color,</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver, a pale grey color,</p>

<p>Nitric acid, a pale yellow color.</p>

<p>The above reactions, separate or united, are insufficient;
they are not very delicate, and are likewise produced by stains
originating from the other varieties of mucus: the indications
furnished by a microscopic examination of the stains are alone
conclusive.</p>

<p><i>Microscopic examination.</i>&mdash;Semen contains as its principal
and fecundating constituent, peculiar vibratory filaments,
(<i>spermatozoa</i>), held suspended in a viscous fluid. These filaments,
when preserved in a warm and moist place, retain their
activity for a considerable time: it is even possible that they
may exhibit vitality in the organs, into which they have been
voluntarily or forcibly ejaculated, for ten, or even twenty-four
hours. When exposed to cold air, the spermatozoa quickly
expire; still, they preserve their form for some time, and, as
this is very characteristic, it is then easy to identify them;
moreover, since they originate exclusively in the testicles, their
detection may be considered as certain evidence of the presence
of semen. In stains produced by aged persons, and by
persons enfeebled by excesses, the spermatozoa fail to be
presented; in case they are discovered, this fact evidently does
not affect the certainty of the spermatic origin of the stains.
The contrary conclusion is never absolutely certain: still, if
the use of the microscope fails to establish the presence of
spermatozoa, it is almost certain that the stains were not produced
by semen.</p>

<p>Of the various methods for obtaining from the stains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
preparation adapted to the microscopic examination, the one
proposed by M. Charles Robin is the most simple and reliable.</p>

<p>A strip, 1 c.&nbsp;c. in size (comprising the entire stain, if this
be small, containing its inner portion, if it be large), is cut from
the fabric under examination, care being taken that the two
extremities of the sample extend beyond the stained portion.</p>

<p>One end of the cloth is then immersed in a capsule, or
watch-glass, containing pure water: the stains become moistened
by capillary attraction, and, in a space of time varying
from twenty minutes to two hours, acquire the appearance of
fresh semen. As soon as the stained portion becomes swollen
and softened, the surface of the cloth is gently scraped with
a spatula, and the substance removed placed on the slide of
the microscope. The particles are next slightly detached, a
drop of water added, if necessary, and the whole covered
with a small plate of very thin glass. The preparation is then
examined by a microscope, having a magnifying power of from
500 to 600 diameters. In this way, the presence of either
entire or broken spermatozoa is readily detected. Their existence
is rendered still more apparent, if the mucus present
is dissolved by adding a drop of acetic acid to the preparation.</p>

<p>Entire spermatozoa consist of long slender filaments, having
a length of 0.04041 to 0.04512 millimetre; the anterior extremity
presents an oval enlargement, either round or pyriform, exhibiting
a double outline, when magnified to 500 diameters. This
enlarged end is termed the "head;" the entire remaining
portion being regarded as the "tail." In case the spermatozoa
are broken, they are severed either near the head or in the
middle of the tail, and a mass of detached fragments will be
observed in the microscopic examination. The spermatozoa
are not the only corpuscules revealed by the microscope; other
substances, entirely different in character, are often observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Although the detection of these bodies is, in itself, of no value,
it will be well to enumerate and characterize them; they are:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Oily globules.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Leucocytes, or spherical and finely granulous globules
of mucus.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Corpuscules, originating from the seminal vesicles,
termed sympexions. These are rounded or ovoid, possess
an irregular outline, and are usually mixed with the spermatozoa
and globules of mucus.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Crystals of phosphate of magnesia, varying greatly in
size; the largest are from 0.mm.&nbsp;001 to 0.mm.&nbsp;002 in length.
The crystals formed upon cooling the semen, present the form
of an oblique prism, with a rhomboidal base. Occasionally
they are elongated and flattened; they then assume the form
of a rhomboid.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Epithelial cells; originating from the mucous follicles of
the urethra.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Irregular grains of dust; soluble in acetic and hydrochloric
acids, with gaseous evolution.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Brownish-red grains of rust; only slightly soluble in
acetic acid, but easily soluble in hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Filaments of the strained fabric; detected by their
texture, and general appearance.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> Grains of starch, in case the cloth has been stiffened.
These are almost invariably swollen, and are frequently broken
and deformed.</p>

<p>If the examination is to be secretly executed, and the cloth
cannot well be cut, it is rolled in a cone, in such a way that
the external side contains the stained portion. The lower
extremity of the cone (which should be free from stains) is
dipped in a watch-glass containing water, so as to avoid
directly wetting the stains. The cone soon becomes moistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
by absorption, and the operation is then completed in the
same manner as when the fabric has been cut; which is
always preferable, when possible.</p>

<p>The examination of spermatic stains consists, then, in
moistening the stains with water, separating them as completely
as possible from the stained cloth, and determining
the presence of the spermatozoa by means of the microscope.</p>

<p>All other tests are valueless; even their execution for
confirmatory purposes is not advisable; inasmuch as they fail
to possess a distinctive character, and the reagents employed
in their production may destroy the fabric, and thus prevent
the formation of the only conclusive reaction&mdash;the detection
of the spermatozoa.</p>

<p>In case the stains are deposited upon a woman's chemise,
they are usually present on both the front and back portions,
and are sometimes to be found on the sleeves. When a man's
shirt is under examination, especial attention should be given
to the anterior portions. The pantaloons are also often stained;
usually in the interior, but sometimes also on the exterior,
just above the thighs. In reporting the decision to the
court, as to the nature of the stains, their precise position
should invariably be stated, as, by this means, the circumstances
attending the commission of the crime may be, at
least partially, elucidated.</p>

<p>Within the last few years the subject of food-adulteration
has been so prominently brought before the public
that, in many instances, the various State Boards of Health
have commissioned their chemists to furnish reports on
this subject. These may be found in the annual publications
of the same, notably in the volumes issued by the
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York State
Boards of Health. It may also be mentioned in this connection
that the <i>Sanitary Engineer</i> of New York, the <i>Analyst</i>
of London, the <i>Zeitschrift für Untersuchung von Lebensmitteln</i>,
Eichstatt, and the <i>Zeitschrift gegen Verfälschung der
Lebensmittel</i>, Leipzig, are journals devoted to the consideration
of adulterations and the more recent methods employed
for their detection.</p>

drawn out, its end roughened by filing, and then immersed in solution of bichloride of
platinum, so that a drop or two of the fluid adheres. The point, upon heating, now
acquires a fine metallic lustre, and by repeating the operation a few times a good coating
of platinum is produced both on the exterior and interior of the tube.&mdash;<i>Trans.</i>

prevented by <i>slowly</i> adding the arsenical solution to the generating flask. In order to
avoid loss of arsenetted hydrogen, the cold dish should be directly applied to the flame
even before the introduction of the suspected solution, and its position changed at short
intervals, so as to allow the deposit to be formed on different parts.&mdash;<i>Trans.</i>

Owing to the impurities often occurring in zinc, the use of distilled magnesium in Marsh's
apparatus has also been suggested. This metal is now to be obtained in a state of great
purity; it is, however, sometimes contaminated with silicium, which body likewise gives
rise to a metallic deposit, but one that is readily distinguished from arsenical spots by
its insolubility in nitric acid, <i>aqua regia</i>, and in hypochlorite of soda. The presence
of magnesium causes the precipitation of the non-volatile metals possibly contained in the
fluid tested for arsenic.&mdash;<i>Trans.</i>

<div class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7" href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span
class="label">[G]</span></a>The omission
in the text of Reinsch's test should be supplied. This test is based upon the fact that
when solutions of arsenious acid or an arsenide are acidulated with hydrochloric acid and
boiled with metallic copper, the latter becomes covered with a film consisting largely of
metallic arsenic: it is extensively employed in chemico-legal examinations. The materials
to be examined are completely disintegrated by boiling with hydrochloric acid, and the
fluid filtered. Some pure copper gauze or foil, having a polished surface, is then
immersed in the boiling solution, and notice taken of the formation of a grey deposit. If
a coating be formed, fresh pieces of the metal are added, so long as they become affected.
The copper is then withdrawn from the solution, thoroughly washed with water, and dried,
either by means of the water-bath or by pressing between bibulous paper. It is next
introduced into a dry tube, and heated over a spirit lamp. The arsenic present volatilizes
and is oxidized to arsenious acid which forms a deposit, consisting of octahedral
crystals, on the cold part of the tubes. These are subsequently tested by means of the
reactions distinctive of arsenious acid. It need hardly be added that the absolute purity
of both the hydrochloric acid and of the copper is to be carefully established. The
deposit obtained in the above operation was formerly regarded as pure arsenic, but it has
been proved to be an alloy consisting of 32 per cent. arsenic, and 68 per cent. copper.
Reinsch's test possesses the advantage of requiring but little time for its execution, of
being applicable to complex organic mixtures, and of effecting the detection of a very
minute trace of the poison.&mdash;<i>Trans.</i>

materials with water, filtering the fluid, acidulating the filtrate with hydrochloric
acid, and testing two portions: one with sesquichloride of iron, the other with
protosulphate of iron. If either of the above salts be present, a blue precipitate is

detection of alum in bread is desired, a portion of the crumb is incinerated in a platinum
dish, the ash is treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid, the filtered solution
evaporated to dryness, and the residue treated with hydrochloric acid, which now leaves
the silica present undissolved. The acid solution is then filtered, nearly neutralized
with carbonate of soda, and an alcoholic solution of potassa added in excess. The earthy
phosphates present are now precipitated, alumina remaining in solution. The use of aqueous
potassa in this case&mdash;as well as in the case mentioned in the text&mdash;is not advisable, as it
is seldom entirely free from alumina. Upon slightly acidulating the alkaline filtrate with
hydrochloric acid, and adding carbonate of ammonia, the alumina present is precipitated,
and may be dried and tested by means of the reaction with nitrate of cobalt before the
blow-pipe. <br/>
In the quantitative estimation of alumina, the phosphoric acid usually present in the
precipitate should be removed. This is done by dissolving the precipitate in nitric acid
and immersing a piece of metallic tin in the boiling solution: phosphoric acid is thrown
down as a mixture of stannic oxide and phosphate, and the alumina is then precipitated as
usual by carbonate of ammonia.&mdash;<i>Trans.</i>
